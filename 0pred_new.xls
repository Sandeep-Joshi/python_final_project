if you want a delicious steak cooked to your likeling this is the place.  best tasting porterhouse in baltimore.  also the sommelier is very good and doesn't andquot;up sellandquot; you.	0
not only is the ambience amazing, but the food and drinks were just as great. i can't wait to return and explore the menu some more... i defiantly recommend trying this place	1
dinela fail! i usually avoid giving negative reviews, but this restaurant was just disappointing.  -came here for the hanger steak, as advertised in the dinela menu online, only to find this replaced with less exciting entrees such as chicken breast and salad. -ordered the grilled market corn from the regular menu instead, and requested to cut this into thirds for our party of three, but learned they couldn't because they had already precut their corn into halves. so our waitress said we could either order three halves at an additional cost, or the three of us can just share two halves. lol! like we can take turns eating off the same corn? and they can't just take a new corn and cut it into thirds? -forgot our pink eggs with ham. -forgot my friend's beer too. -lastly, if anyone reading this still plans on going, my advice is to order meat well done, because my friend's and mediumand  lamb burger looked raw! :-o	0
the service was outstanding but the food was quite pricey and fell short of expectations. very little crab meat in the $18 kao phad pu fairly bland $13 phad mi.	0
so perch. was interesting. the decor is beautiful and the roof top views are breathtaking. that alone would be worth a visit.  i have to take points away for the food and the crowd, though. this place attracts the type of la-ian that fulfills the stereotypes of everyone who doesn't live in la. there was quite a bit of pretentiousness in the air and a lot of indoor shades wearing. some people were just downright rude. or maybe i'm *too* southern. i haven't figured that part out yet.  the food was - eh. ok. i ordered the heuvos rancheros and one of my companions ordered the crab benedict. neither one of us were impressed, but the third member of our party raved about the french toast. so there's that.  our waitress was super cool. very, very friendly, laidback, easygoing, all the good things you want from your server. the bartender on the rooftop bar was super cool as well (and very funny).   i think this place is worth a visit or two, but i wouldn't go back if i am ever in la again.	0
i don't know if it was the cake or the ice cream it was served with but something had a hint of coriander and it was to die for... omg... 	1
take a time-travel trip to the 1950s just by walking into the pantry on figueroa and 9th in downtown la. i felt like i was in a black-and-white noir movie, and the characters sitting at the counter were integral to the cast. in fact the whole decor (if you can call it that) is black and white. a woman sitting in a booth near the door takes your money - no credit cards, please; hey, it's the '50s. the menu - including wonderful old standards like spaghetti and meat balls, meat loaf, and french toast - is on the wall. i told a friend, a native angeleno, that i was going to be in downtown la for a convention and he said i had to stop in at the pantry. he was right. i hope that all the cool people now living downtown aren't too cool to eat here!	1
ordered a chicken noodle soup last week b/c i had a cold and my wonderful husband brought it to me @ work (it was on the way to my job... i should have made him detour to la carreta or sergio's.) i was so upset when i opened the paper bag... the soup was like nothing i had ever seen before. chicken fat (yes! fat! the part most people trim and discard), parts of tendon-y veiny chicken, not one piece of white breasty edible meat, about 10 noodles total, potato chunks the size of olives (and about 5 or 6 of them) and absolutely no flavor at all. completely unacceptable and disgusting. i will never ever order from this place or recommend them to anyone.	0
this place rocks. i came here a couple of days ago for lunch. i had the beef rendang. very friggin good. generous portion too. my friend f got a couple of hand rolls which looked awesome and she loved.   again, this place would be 5 stars if they took credit cards and if they were open for dinner. but i love it!!!	1
it pains me to leave a bad review, i wanted this place to be great, but my experiences were not.  service wasn't bad, but the food was. the best way i can describe it is overpriced mismatched foods on a plate. everything had a strange assortment of american ingredients that just didn't blend well. nobody really enjoyed their meal, and we left somewhat disappointed.   i hope they improve, because the location has everything working for them...	0
the food was elegant and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. i would recommend you ask for a table by the fireplace for a more relaxed area instead of by the door and casino	1
i've eaten at a few different locations and they are all great. the food is healthy, fresh and quite good for something coming out of a steam table. it's very quick service and great for an on the go lunch. great concept.	1
i think it's pretty difficult to find really good coffee in the ev. besides honeyhaus on 11th and 1st i think cafe silan is a winner. i usually get the chai tea and my tastebuds have never tasted something so delicious.  their food is pretty phenomenal as well. i had a frittata and their sandwiches are pretty tasty!	1
if you're not a fan of homeless people panhandling while grubbing...this is not the spot for you. but, if you like killer salads and paninis...this could definitely be your spot.my favorites...the farmer's market salad and the caprese panini.service is helpful, but not smothery.prices are super affordable. did i mention they deliver?did i mention they've got killer fries?	1
spicy miso ramen fo your soul!!i've tried other menus but spicy miso ramen is far my favorite.their fried chicken is also pretty good!i don't really recommend chicken bowl because it was just rice with dry chicken breast...unless you like it	1
fat sals deli boasts extra wide hero bread, but it is no bigger than a subway. and there is nothing and fatand  about their sandwhiches. you would think they'd be so stuffed with goodness that you wouldn't be able to get your mouth around it....no. very skimpy on the ingredients for a $10 sandwhich. fries are the super skinny kind smothered in lettuce and hot sauce, making it appear a bigger serving than it is. if you want a unique kind of sandwhich, this is the place, but don't expect a lot for your money. totally dissappointed.	0
overhyped and overpriced!  food the pizza is ny style thin crust. it was okay, not spectular enough to be worth $5 a slice! i've had wayyy better pizza for half the price. imo costco pizza even tastes better.  white pizza - just okay. really heavy-handed on the ricotta. there was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.  cheese pizza - average. kinda greasy  mushroom - average  sausage and pepperoni - probably the better one of them all. it actually had some flavor to it.   service sucked! pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. the lady who helped us was rude. honestly seemed like she hated her job. just gave us her frowning face and asked us what we wanted. the pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn't even really look all appealing. but since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. she only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. so our food was half warm, half cold.   ambiance this place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the blue ribbon sushi place. but there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. at first, we couldn't find it and had to ask someone where it was. the lady just said to walk down the long halfway and it'll be there. the place is pretty much just a counter with some side counters and chairs to eat but that's pretty much it. nothing memorable.  definitely won't be back. come on cosmopolitan, i would have expected better dining places!	0
this is a great place to build your own burger and if it is done just write it may be one of the best burgers u ever had it even tops umami if u dont overkill on ingredients. the milkshakes they have also are great and the sweet potato fries are delicious make sure to ask for extra radish mayo sauce	1
big place with what appears to be a busy bar scene.  the food was average, but relative to the cost of non-fast food resturants in the area, a decent deal.  located not too far off the strip and easy to get too with decent parking.	1
you just can't beat the setting of this place. the patio is beautiful. we decided to check out the newly renovated bar. i thought it was beautiful as well. rustic wood beams and walls share the space with elegant chandeliers and mirrors. everyone else was expecting something different so i got the feeling they were a little disappointed. that's what happens when you have expectations. they drinks are ok, a little pricey at $11 a pop. i was not impressed with my appetizers. ordered gorgonzola fries (meh) and caponata (meh). i'm used to caponata being a spread (which i prefer) but it was chunky and hard to eat with the bread.  all of this would not stop me from returning to the cliff's edge however. it is a space like no other, at least in east la.	1
verde is defiantly one of the more unique eateries in town...not many other sit down restaurants with good food at and world classand  museums in this city. first off don't come hungry and expect to be fed quickly, seating is limited and in my 2 experiences here there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table that was more like an hour...make reservations,bring a snack, or stroll through the museum if you plan on dining. the food has been on point, good ceviche, decent french fries, and the chicken under a brick entree was excellent. beware the servers will try to up sell (hustle) you into big bottles of water, cocktails, appetizers, desserts, and coffee...you could really get away with sharing an entree but after the wait your belly will do the deciding...one thing for sure, you can't beat the one of a kind view straight down government cut past the port of miami with all the cruise ships. it's only open till 6pm most days, except thursday till 9pm, but of a bummer since the view at night is great for sipping cocktails.	1
veal dish sent back. tough as an old boot. bread was decent. service ok. doesn't look like they finished the restaurant if so not well done. would not recommend.	0
we were just there for xmas eve dinner. everything was great. the prices are sort of mid-rangey to low and the food is high quality. even the ketchup was made in-house. they just recently opened, so there will be a larger menu in a few months, and kinks are being worked out. the lights are kept low, tasteful decor. basically it's a french bistro...but american. welcome to the neighborhood!reading the other reviews, i hope they never have a happy hour. i will gladly pay regular price to avoid a happy hour crowd. you probably don't need it.	1
great pizza and salad! and love the espresso and ice cream dessert. casual atmosphere with fun food.	1
i've been to donna's for lunch many times and have always enjoyed the experience. went to dinner with my family and found that the value just wasn't there . the lamb meatball with polenta dish was mediocre, as was the meatloaf and spaghetti bolognese.  my husband's dinner-sized caesar was just ok.  most of the selection was priced over $20, yet didn't seem worth it. glasses of wine were at $9 minimum and martinis set at $03.50 ... not cheap. i thought this was a cafe?!. i'll probably be back for lunch, but will definitely skip supper.	0
this has to be the worst sports bar i've ever been to. i ordered a burger with only bacon and cheese and the burger came with everything on it with 2 strips of bacon on a plate. we couldn't order a cup of water because he said the ice machine doesn't work so we had to buy bottled water. when i told him the burger order was wrong he told me to just scrap off the stuff i didn't want...... wow. the burger was undercooked and cold we paid and left. worst experience ever. the tvs are crappy and you can barely see the game on them. he was also kicking people out who didn't order food with there drinks. i do boy recommend this place to anybody. nothing could have been worse than this experience.	0
authentic quaint mexican restaurant. decent sized portions, great taste	0
this location has finally added more of their food items to the menu which is now displayed on multiple large lcd screens. the bi-bim-bap rice balls are yummy yummy - the size of a baseball with veggies and mayo dressing on top and shredded flavored chicken stuffed in the center. the sal sal chicken strips are fried battered with rice crumbs and comes with a dipping sauce of either apple, garlic, mango, or ranch (mango is the best). there are also now salads, a sal sal rice bowl, wraps, and grilled chicken. the wings are still bomb!	1
i didn't realize that this was pretty much an alleyway until i finally sat down at a table and looked around at where i was at. food quality:their wasabi fries was good! and thank goodness that it was their fries that was really good and not just the wasabi sauce.their samurai burger was somewhat interesting because the flavors were mild and nice, but a little pain to it since it was stacked so high. their meat (cooked to medium) was not very soft and only mildly juicy. not really a fan of their burgers.however, points to their cocktails and drinks. all i know (and can remember) is that i enjoyed them and didn't cringe at any of it. food 3.5/5. service:the waitress we got was friendly, nice, and polite. was pretty attentive up until the point where it got really busy.environment:i like the outdoor environment a lot because it is entirely relaxing during the night. dim lighting in the outdoors, but still warm due to the space heaters. ambiance can be a little loud due to the narrow space but for some odd reason it doesn't take away from the relaxing atmosphere.i like this place solely for its environment and drinks. i think it's a great place to just sit down and relax with some friends over a drink and possibly maybe dinner should you choose some yummies that other yelpers recommend.	1
this was a great discovery after a long day. we got the chicken drunken noodles and beef pad thai, both were plentifully large and expertly prepared. the drunken noodles were just spicy enough to remember how much you love water, and the pad thai was a nice balance of flavors.	1
not only does this place offer delish burgers with ramen noodles substituting the bun, but awesome customer service as well! we first tried the ramen burger at a ramen food festival in lil tokyo, and decided it was one of the best burgers eva! looking for another tasty experience, we went to the actual restaurant or more closely resembling a take-out window. this time the experience was lackluster. i was really surprised that the ramen burger didn't have a lot of flavor, so i figured something must be missing. i messaged jeffrey the business owner and told him about my experience. he offered two free burgers to make up for my past experience. when my bf and i tried the burger again, it was exactly the flavorful experience i remembered. apparently one of the signature sauces was missing. they also threw in some free fries and drinks as well! talk about making up for a bad experience!	1
i've been here several times. each time the service is slower and slower. we were the only ones in there and ordered wings. it took 50 minutes. the bar is fine. no problems. it's their kitchen. we received our food after two other groups that arrived after us. we only ordered the wings.   the two stars is for the bar. they did however run out of co2 without having a backup. weird.	0
the caesar salad was excellent, served in a crust of baked parmagian cheese.  one order is good for 2 people to share.	1
when back and the line was super long. the food seemed rushed. the favors where a little off. when i got up to order they seemed annoyed that i was asking for food.   not sure i'll go back again soon.	0
just tried range for lunch and had a great experience. the staff was super helpful and made good recommendations. the space is very nice, open with lots of light near the front of the house where we sat. we had a couple sandwiches (turkey and the veggie burger) and a salad (beet), all very tasty. i'll definitely go back and am looking forward to trying out their beer / wine / drinks list.	1
went there not too long ago to try their mac and cheese, and it was the worst. super stale and just not cheesy at all. debating on whether to give this place a second chance or not. side notes: my friend let me try some of her french toast and it was good. second side note, their fries were decent:	0
this is going to seem petty and dumb, but...	0
this was a wonderful experience and our first time there. the house made pastas were delicious. the highlight was the superb service by david with each dish being described completely so we didn't even need to consult the menu. we definitely look forward to returning to this spot and can't wait to try some of the other dishes.	1
my new favorite breakfast spot! parking sucks...the street is one hour parking except sundays. but people come and go, so just be patient. and it is so worth it. try the flapjacks, or even better the new yorker!	1
ordered via grubhub, and delivery was prompt. unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. i ordered the spicy garlic caramelized prawns, $ 10.95 and the coconut curry tofu and veggie $ 9.50. the prawn dish was decent, a bit too sweet and salty with more grease than necessary. in both dishes, the vegetables were roughly cut, without much apparent care. the prawn dish included baby carrots - the kind you buy at the supermarket to snack on. that was a bit of a red flag - if the chefs can't be bothered to cut the veggies, i have to wonder what other corners are being cut.i would nor order from nan king again.	0
get the potato pancake, kimchee fried rice and dumplings for your sides. wear your bib. and they play all the 90's hip hop jams.	1
i guess one of my familys favorite soup place. my sis and her bf went all around korea town to find best soup place and ended back at this place as usual not too long ago. pros1. taste pretty darn good and good portion!2. clean and long hours 3. good parking ( unless you go their on weekend night, plenty of parking always !) 4. no wait. and okay service -never experienced bad service yet even when they are busy. cons1. price has been steadily going up for this place. i actually think it is bit pricy for a soup.	1
what a gem! food is delicious and the place is beautiful. ate there a few times and tried different dishes, all were fresh and very tasty. i especially enjoyed the mediterranean breakfast, shakshuka, fancy grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato jam!!), and stumptown coffee! the staff and owners are very friendly and the free wifi is a big plus!	1
luna park is just a few blocks away and it's a great place to go for some comfort food close to home. and yes their milkshakes are the best. the apple caramel is my favorite	1
don't give up! keeping looking for parking! this place is so worth it.  it's located down a narrow alley. easy to miss, but not too hard to find. went on a sunday night and got seated very quickly. the actual place was a lot smaller than expected, but it was nicely set up with plenty of tables + heat lamps + hanging lights.   happy hour deals are great. our party ordered the moscow mule (my favorite), margarita, bees knees, and a mojito. we enjoyed all of them; most of the cocktails were on the strong side-just as the waiter had mentioned. we also ordered the popular wasabi fries. it had a subtle kick to it, but it just wasn't our thing. we opted for no wasabi sauce on our 2nd order and it tasted just like garlic fries. yum.  my cousins and i loved this place and we will definitely be back.	1
look at me, eating my own words. my office orders lunch in once a week for everyone and we've been pushing for papalote for a while. the office is at the far edge of the financial district, almost at the embarcadero, and papalote is... no where near it. shouldn't be a problem, we'll just taskrabbit it, right? hmmm... not quite that easy. just to make sure, i called paplote on friday (for a tuesday order) to make sure there would be no issue with paying on the phone and putting it under someone else's name to pick it up. the girl i spoke with said that wouldn't be a problem, and they only need an hour or so lead time. monday rolls around, and i get everyone's order together to place. call them up, give them my order, seems smooth until i try to pay. they inform me that only the manager can take payment over the phone and give me her name and tell me to call back at 11am tuesday for an 11:30 pickup. so i call just after 11am on tuesday. i ask to speak with the manager directly, and instead of getting a normal response, i get a question... who is that? i repeat the name i was given and am rudely informed that there is no one there with that name. i ask to speak to the manager on duty and am told they're not in yet. i inform them that i was told to call at 11am because that's when the manager would be there, and i need my food to be ready by 11:30am because i already have a taskrabbit ready to pick it up, and this is just not okay. i hear her set the phone down and tell the "manager" everything i just said. apparently the "manager" was there this whole time and not taking calls. the same rude girl comes back and says fine, i'll take your credit card info. (i thought only the "manager" could?) so i give it to her, and she says ok, just bring it in with you. i tell her that's not going to happen because we have someone else on their way to pick it up, i can't have them come to the office, grab my card, and then bring it all the way there just to show it, and eitherway, it's my card, and i'm not the one picking it up. as if she wasn't rude enough, she's basically yelling at me saying that they can't do it. now it's my turn to be firm, and i tell her that she has to do this. i have a whole office of hungry people waiting, i've already set someone up to go pick it up, and she's basically lost at least 10 customers today. all in all, they finally agreed to process the order. by the time the food got here, it was a little cold, but fine. i have never experienced such horrible customer service. i was a regular here, but haven't been back since.	0
so creative and delicious! every time i come the menu has new things. i like to go with friends and order a bunch of things to share. and don't forget the cocktails, amazing crafty tastiness! the one with the smoldering cinnamon stick is a delight for your nose and taste buds! who would have guessed that lacma would be hiding one of the better restaurants in la?!	1
excellent food and sevice. a four hour dinner that seemed like a very pleasant hour thanks to the staff's pacing of attentiona and service	1
i've been here for brunch one day, and it was ok. but happy hour! happy hour is really good here. i normally get the sangria, which is $6 a glass, or if you plan on drinking, get the bowl for 3 for $14.50. it's well worth it. you can easily get 3.5-4 glasses at least from it. in addition, you have to get the fries, it's $3 with 3 different kinds of sauces. those are my two favs for happy hour here. there's always normally a dinner happy hour too, the portions are large and it looks good. the sliders were ok. the only negative is that happy hour is at the bar, so sometimes it fills up fast, so it's hard to find a seat. otherwise, it's great, and i love going there.	1
grade : b	1
this is why the marina has a bad reputation. why on earth would you wait, outside, on a cold and rainy night, for thirty minutes or more, to get into some stupid bar just because it's new and "trendy" when there are other perfectly serviceable bars right next door. because it's been open for a week? and you want to say you've been there already? lame.this bar is insanely packed, filled with people who seem to think life is one long cocktail party and who probably don't even realize this place is a gastropub and probably has really good food. i unfortunately had to deal with all this for a friend's goodbye party or else i would never go here in the first place. i will never come here after nine again.one star for the super nice guy at the door who was doing a good job running the line and staying friendly.	0
this place made me sad i was looking forward to coming here. the staff was nice and the place looked cool but the food man....the food wasn't that good. i got tonkatsu shoyu and it had a weird off taste to it. my grandpa got the karaga and it tasted off too. the pork was good had nice flavor but was tough its like i needed a knife to cut it. :( this is the first time i had a bad review for a ramen place and it makes me sad.	0
truthfully, i am torn in this review. the shanghai soup dumplings were delicious. the other dumplings were just about average, definitely not mind-blowing. i consider myself a dumpling connoisseur so i know when a dumpling is legit.that said, it's a long trek to get out to this place. it's a tiny space and gets really warm inside. we had a really negative experience in terms of leaving the restaurant with less than full bellies, which is never a good sign. please tell me if you have ever had a restaurant deny your request to order more food. kod denied our requests to order more food. i mean, really?! what is the business you're running? i seriously doubt i will ever come back, given the inconvenient location and how i was completely blocked from ordering more food. yank sing has xiao long bao that is comparable, even if it is pricier. at least i know i can eat to my heart's content there and if i need to order more, i am free to do so. also, the man with the blow torch making creme brulee = tort suit waiting to happen. seriously a hazard. i thought he was going to burn someone's arm, the way he was waving it around.if you don't mind the drive, then would definitely recommend going for the soup dumplings. if that's all you're after, i'd just go to yank sing.	0
hmm, i must admit i was expecting good pizza judging by the reviews.   honestly, the pizza wasn't very good... a frozen digiorno crust is better. my whole group left feeling, wow, what a let down.   eating outside being cooled off by powerful aerial misters, completely surrounded by traffic was pretty cool though.	0
very very dry chicken! 18 dollars for mcdonalds quality chicken. disappointing. the brussel sprouts salad is good though, however the portions are quite small and you won't leave feeling full if thats what you're looking for. probably the burgers aren't bad based off the pictures. for a couple not worth $45+	0
we have been to the inn with a large group and just as a couple, and have been very happy with the food and the service.	0
this place is great! good service and great (local!) food. almost everything in the restaurant is sourced from within a 360 degree radius of seattle (there are certain things that just don't grow in the pnw, so they get them from the closest/best location possible). this is a go-to place for us when we have people visiting from out of town.	0
i just came by here tonight, this place beats the boiling crab, we walked in and right away we got a table with no waiting. the shrimp was great food is similar to boiling crab without the 1 to 2 hour wait. customer service was great also they were on top of things. this place will be my regular spot for seafood!	1
very chill... just a nice, "easy to be" place when it isn't crowded. great bartenders, both shifts! and, now, it just looks so much better the the lights working. the projector seemed like overkill, particularly since it was beaming regular tv... (ok, maybe it was cable...) live music provided for great ambiance.	1
the kona steak is amazing.  not sure why it adds so much flavor but this is the second time i have had it and did not disappoint.  nice service.  very patient with us as we poured over the wine selection.  also very open and friendly, last time waiter was a bit stiff and patronizing.	1
i usually don't wander down to tribeca, but my roommate tried this restaurant the other night and said it was a must. the cocktails are fun and delicious, the food was well plated and tasty and the dessert was awesome! even more than good food, the service was really a notch above the rest...and well, they have popcorn...free popcorn.   let me explain something; i make the best popcorn (ever!), so i always try the popcorn when it's offered at the restaurant. wow, this was so good!! i am totally going to copy the recipe. korean hot pepper seasoning and no butter added...um, this is even healthier than my popcorn for my clients! score. okay, enough with the popcorn.  the wings were really just wings in my mind, and quite messy, but for the wing conesuer, you may feel differently. the two winners for me: the tuna appetizer and the scallop main course. we also had the steak (i'm not a big steak eater, but the garlic bone marrow butter was different and yummy!), the mushroom side dish (wow!!) and the crusty bread (which was topped with horseradish...honestly, could have done without this and just had a plate of horseradish).   and to end things, the dessert was so good!!!!! i love s'mores and this was such a cool dish! the waiter joked about how the restaurant wants to offer a kit table side with a blow torch for people to make their own s'mores. yeah, not sure how that would go over. ;-) maybe if it were a table of tea teetotalers.   ps. the pinot noir was yum (by the glass).	1
the perch is absolutely beautiful. the view is amazing, the way they decorated along with the arrangement of furniture is amazing, and there's a live band! i am usually annoyed with live bands but its not distracting music, its just great conversation/food eating music.   it is a bit pricey, but you're paying for the experience.	1
definitely a local/hipster spot. $2 miller high life so those looking for a deal. the backyard is nice to hang out in during warm weather months, but the inside is just a bit too grimey looking for me.	0
how can you have a world class butcher shop with dry aged beef downstairs, and not serve any dry aged meats on the menu!!!!!	0
dont go to this place. me and my friend to to this place and it was empty with just two employees at the bar. we went to use the bathroom before we looked at the menu. the owner ask what we wanted already started with an attitude. we looked at the menu and decided to leave. the owner started to accuse us of just using the bathroom, which we didn't. he basically was started a fight with us, he can barely walk from how drunk he was. he called us all names in the book. the sum of it... don't even waste your time here, i never seen so much disrespect from a business owner.	0
this place is nothing to brag about! the menu is overwhelming, too much going on in it. the nachos taste like they have pace salsa and cheese whiz, the skirt stake was too salty, and the pizza and lamb tacos were extremely greasy!   the service is horrible! 40 minutes for a burger and stake is absurd, and the food was cold. the wait staff took some time asking us for drink orders so we had to place them at the bar.   overall, i would not recommend this place to eat. you can get better tasting food and service some place else.	0
this place could be so much better, the food and the services was very good and fast. but the prices and the decorations were very disappointed, everything look very old and out dated, plus the sides didnt have prices on the menu and when the bill came a single side of mashed potatoes was 7.5!!!! i think it is the most expensive mashed potatoes in town, and it was very simple and plain nothing special. also one of waitress was looking at my phone when i was on groupon and asked me to redeem my coupon when i told him i didnt even bought it yet?!?! i still dont understand why was he looking at my phone neither the urge to redeem my groupon when i was still eating. i think this place have good potential but they have lots of work and good training to do.	0
fine i'll give them 2.5 stars, i was really not impressed. i had the 5 spice chicken ban mee. the chicken was moist but it needed more spice in the chicken. overall the sandwich tasted fresh and not as fatty as a authentic ban mee but it's missing the salty pate. the pate should be in all the sandwiches. i was craving papaya salad so i got it and was majorly disappointed. they added vermicelli noodles in the salad which is so not supposed to be in there at all. there was a few slivers of papaya and all noodles and peanuts. i also didn't taste any shrimp paste in the sauce or saw any dry shrimp in it. this place is obviously catered to rich white folks. no way in hell should my meal be $10.i was watching the mexican chefs cooking all the vietnamese food and noticed the sweet potato fries are frozen out of a plastic bag.	0
we've been here numerous times and love it! the staff is always super sweet and the chef is on point. really good vibes in here always. today we popped in for brunch and yum yum yum. i'm really excited for summer time patio meals when it warns up. this has definitely become one if my neighborhood favorites.	1
this was our forth visit to the capital grille, las vegas, and we have never been disappointed.  for starters, try the calamari, prepared with peppers to add a little heat, without being overpowering, lightly breaded, a great choice. the lobster bisque soup was also excellent, with a creamy broth and ample pieces of lobster. the mainstay of the capital grille is steaks, which were prepared exactly to order.  for a restaurant in a beautiful room overlooking the las vegas strip they might be able to offer merely good food and average service, but they never do.  our server was, friendly, professional, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. a great choice for fine dining in las vegas, we will definitely be back.	1
i've been traveling around the los angeles downtown area and i just happened to want a burger while walking by it so i went. i really didn't expect much but since the i could customize my burger, it was perfect for me. the bun was really good and they got me the exact medium beef i had asked for. their fries were hot and crunchy which was just a-mazing! i totally recommend this place if you're near-by. however some of you might not enjoy it as much as i did because it's basically the same as any other custom burgers. still, the burger was really tasty. my husband says that we should come here again if we visit los angeles again.	1
the food is perfect. please grease the guy at the front door regardless if its busy or not because he really works hard and. deserves it. the bathroom floors are moped with bacon grease so be careful. you're not an angelinos if you don't love it. fyi	1
my wife and i had the salt caramel ice cream after our lunch today in colombia city. 	1
the bartender was on her cellphone while working, friday july, 11th. 2014. instead of paying attention of her job	0
drop whatever restaurant you were thinking of and just go here. beautiful restaurant, bar, with equally beautiful food. you will not be sorry! the niscoise salad is the most beautiful one i have seen, the tartare is one the best i've had. i can't say enough- what a lovely experience.	1
very nice atmosphere, very tasty food that came out incredibly fast. the prices aren't too high for chicago downtown. i am definitely coming back :)	1
this is a small place that smells like chicken. there. this sentence defines the place. oh, ok ok, i'll tell you my whole experience there.  so i went there this afternoon, hungry, with my friend who read about this place and said that it was supposed to be really good. i hate when people tell me that because it's usually hype. there was a line inside and another outside. we went to the line inside. a bunch of strange looking people were devouring their chicken like dinosaurs probably did millions of years ago. on my turn, we requested for the and famousand  chicken plate and a hamburger for me, since i was disgusted by the animalistic way people were eating their chicken. the little guy mumbled something like it was going to take a while since they didn't have it ready and walked away looking mad.  are you serious? a trash place like that can afford servers to give you attitude? really? i was shocked. i stared at the smoke coming out of the mountain of pounds and pounds of chicken being cooked and felt sick. really sick. the smell of it was killing me. i told my friend and how can you eat that?and  and canceled my burger. actually, it wasn't that easy. my friend told them and only the chicken, no more hamburgerand  and the guy goes and it's almost readyand . he messed with the wrong person. and what do you mean they can't cancel?and  i said to my friend. they only had put the buns down to cook!  i was even more grossed out because i asked for a burger and was going to get one that smelled like chicken. so i saw the same idiot who told me and noand  going to the other one with a spatula in hand, and the latter looked at me. and then another one. and the manager stared at me too. oh, i am sorry that no one has ever rejected that crap you call food. my friend paid for the chicken and we left. later i was offered a piece of the chicken since i was still hungry and i took a bite of that disgusting-looking chicken. the two stars go to that. the chicken was alright. not worth the hype though.	0
simply delicious! the meat is perfectly cooked as you order it, the sides and sauces are amazing! love it! even though some people complain that the burger size is small--and that was my first reaction when i saw it--it is the perfect portion!!	1
do not order online. just did it and the order never came. after one 1hr waiting, i called and the driver was on his way. 15mins more, and the driver was still coming. after 1:30hr i had to cancel the order. thanks 10fruits, for never delivering my order...	0
i do think they make a good burger but not good enough for those lines. you need to make the greatest burger ever for that kind of cramped wait and these are not the greatest burgers ever. however i went to the red mill in interbay and experience no line friendly service and great food.	0
amazing!!!   don't let the size of this place fool you, it's small but but the food packs a punch. this was my first time trying filipino food. i had the kaldereta backa( it's like beef stew ) the sauce is this light tomato paste with coconut milk, delicious. not overly sweet.the rice was cooked within coconut and garlic, fantastic.   the service was outstanding. she broke down the menu dish by dish. also we had such a great conversation, even the cook came out to see if we needed anything else and converse with us.   in making this a regular spot!	1
would have expected better food as it is quite pricey	1
nice ambience. i thought the integration of barbers and butchers was palpable with the assortment of props.food well made. short rib sandwich was a bit short on the ribs...mouthful of bread with each bite. trout muffins was flavorful. drinks made with effort. nice big square ice cubes put in drinks which i love.	1
the coolest bar i've ever been to. insane gin selection and very eclectic selection of other liquors. small intimate friendly and nearly unfindable.	1
food: 2decor: 3service: 4came here for a dinner date around 9pm. they had some seats open, so we were able to grab a table without a wait.1. pimm's cup, 8~okay.2. grilled little gems, 10market oranges, raw goat's milk feta and oregon hazelnuts~okay. the feta with oranges was a bit odd.3. market mushrooms, 16cave aged gruyere, thyme and roasted onions~disappointing. really didn't like the pizza at all, and any other pizza on the menu probably would have been better. bit surprised that the server recommended this one as the most popular pizza.service was good.	0
happy hour review$1 oysters-not cleaned well, found sand and even a little bug (some green wiggly worm the size of an ant)goat cheese dip w/ old bay potato chips-uneven seasoning on chips, portions were also inconsistent across each order (one table was almost 3x our amount of chips), dip itself was soliddrink and food is on the pricier side and they don't have happy hour food optionsoverall thoughtsbeautiful atmosphere with amazing views but the price point seems unjustifiable	0
jason and his team at food factory have been preparing healthy meals for me the last month in my quest to lose weight and feel better. besides being healthy, they taste great and are reasonably priced. the fact that i now look forward to eating vegetables is a credit to jason's skill as a chef.   the atmosphere at food factory is laid back casual and the service is excellent. food factory is located inside spectators at the corner of durango and flamingo.  check it out !	1
this little jewel off the beat and path is delicious, the food is so yummy. love their morning mangu. sancocho is as close to being in the dominican republic.	1
the restaurant and dinner were good as usual, can't go wrong with the chart house. however, service on this particular night was slow as it took close to 30 minutes for our  starter salads to arrive. despite, the waiter was gracious enough to keep us informed that the kitchen was backed up. we will continue to frequent the chart house.	1
i think this has to be my most favorite restaurant in baltimore! the ambiance is beautiful and the food and service is always consistently excellent! definitely top of my list for a romantic date or special occasion!	0
don't know what happened but this place is pretty terrible now. it used to be so good too. i picked up some food as usual- dumplings, veg fried rice, generals chicken, ate it when i got home and felt sick after. no good. never eating there again	0
great salmon lasagna and duck stroganoff. who would have thought in fall city.	1
tried it out for thr first time and we fell in love with the bar. the bartender was the most outgoing, friendly girl we've ever met. the manager (sal) is truly dedicated to making this place successful and providing a personalized experience for everyone who comes in. highly recommended, coming from someone with 10 years fandb experience.	1
uninspired bland overpriced. any other questions? we had the heirloom tomato salad which was a few tomatoes with mozzarella and basil. not good. very bland. then came the beet gazpacho soup. it had clashing flavors of beet basil and spice. finally came the main entree the grilled pork chop. slightly overlooked bland and uninaginative. the booths are unconformatable and cramped.	0
great food! i had the bahn mi burger (a burger with an and asianand  flavour): delicious. the meat especially, is very tasty.  only cons: we had to wait a little bit more than normal even if there were only a few clients. but nothing serious.  plus: wifi free access and very good fries (not heavy, just perfect).	1
i love this bar. the drinks are strong and worth the price. the crowd is a mix of mid 20's to 30's, and the decor is cute and vintage. i suggest coming here a bit early into the night, so you can get a good seat by the fire place or on the couches. the only negative aspect is how loud it can get.	1
i came here for a late brunch with my sister because we only live a few blocks away. this was my first time eating here, and i was not disappointed! the service was friendly and full of enthusiasm. lots of smiles all around. :) i ordered the granola french toast which comes with four very large slices, with just a touch of powdered sugar garnished with strawberries and a mint leaf. my sister ordered the salt cod scrambled eggs accompanied with a bed of arugula and multi-grain toast. we couldn't think of a better way to start our day! definitely going back. what a piece of heaven!	1
the set menu for valentine's day 2014 was just okay but i get that it's difficult to pull something like that off cost-effectively. i wouldn't do it again to be honest but i will definitely give their full menu another shot. the appetizers at the bar that i tried a few months back were intriguing, as is the extensive wine list. some yummy specialty drinks on offer here as well. the top rate service definitely makes this place feel special. was here for a special occasion in late november and they gave me a box of truffles!	0
the first time i was in sf in 2001, i enjoyed the clam chowder and fried shrimp. i thought these street vendors were a daily street fair. how exciting.last month i returned and i wished i had an extra pair of hands, these sidewalk stands deserve four thumbs down. the clam chowder i had was barely edible (thick oatmeal). it makes me realize that i'd rather be in ny buying a hot dog sitting in boiled water from a cart.this place is tied with nyc times square in terms of worthless crap for tourists to buy.ifhtp 3+	0
i stay at the four seasons about once a month for work, and i absolutely love the press. the service is impeccable (as it is throughout the hotel) and the food is delicious. i've stopped by for breakfast, drinks, and dessert, and greatly enjoyed them all. the last time i was in town i shared the cronuts and banana split with some coworkers. the cronuts were a bit too cold for my colleague's liking, and the manager was extremely apologetic and rushed us out some fresh ones. i can't say enough good things about the four seasons or any of its amenities!	1
i have walked by this place a few times and just based on looks, i never wanted to eat there. it doesn't strike me as a place that serves good food. well ever heard don't judge a book by its cover?  the two guys working there seemed pleasant (this was around 12:30am) and the food was really good. i had the steak and carnitas taco, plus some steak combination taco. all the meat, onions and peppers are cooked right there. it was all tasty and delicious! and cheap. for roughly ten dollars we had 5 great tacos! i recommend going here for a late night munchie......or at any time for that matter.	1
found the food bland did not have the same complex flavors you expect with thai food	0
i am picky about italian food, i can't help it i am an italian new yorker!! four of went here for dinner on a saturday night. portions are definitely large, drinks yummy. we shared 2 apps and were kinda full when dinner came...food was really, really good! service, slow....friendly and efficient, but slow........was a bit annoying for drinks but was kinda nice to have have some extra time between apps and dinner. i strongly recommend	0
this used to be one of our favorite places, we'd come here all the time because it was cheap and healthy food. prices have come up during the years. another thing that's unique and kind of cool is that it's sort of two restaurants in one, you can order from either the and chinois chinoisand  (chinese/pan-asian), or baklava factory's menu. we like them both.	0
we thought the food is amazing. but it is kind of disappointed compared to other michelin one star restaurant. the food is not bad. but just not a michelin one star restaurant. there are definitely many other better options in williamsburg.	0
wow!  wasn't sure what i was getting myself into with this place but was very surprised! french fries that have that golden brown almost carmalized sweet balance where they bend but aren't soggy with a mountain of goodness carefully slapped on top!!  i went with the korean bbq as it was popular and have to tell you that the pork belly was fantastic!! yes it has a jelatinous fat strip on it but it is pork belly afterall!! do it!!!  considering this place recently popped up after hot doug's closing means a new gem in the area and best of all... very reasonably priced!! less than $10 for a canned s. pelligrino and meal makes this place a regular choice for me.	1
just went here with a few friends to sip on some coffee and talk and it was wonderful. i wasn't a huge fan of their sencha green tea which is what i ordered, however loved all of their pastries--especially their almond croissant and sea salt w gyurere cheese croissant. delicious and the place is adorable considering the neighborhood is not so lovely. i would definitely come back here again.	1
two stars only because the patio for brunch was lovely. i wanted to take my mother to brunch since i'd never been and she is from england and i've heard really nice things.  the awkwardness started with the moment the wait staff. our waitress was very robotic when she spoke to us from the get go and when we told her it was our first time here she sort of just waltzed off.  i ordered the and full englishand  and christ whoever thought they could get away with calling it as such is out of their mind. i know the restaurant is supposed to be upscale and portions are usually scaled down in these settings. they didn't even get the recipe right. the tomatoes were 'stewed' and tasted like they came out of a can. full english tomato are fried. the sausage was a chunk of italian, which i need not say more. the beans filled the majority of my already very small $15 plate and they had absolutely no flavor. no bacon rashers to be seen. the only part i slightly enjoyed was the toast and eggs. but i could have made those at home for much less than that price and way more flavor.  it was really underwhelming  my mum had a laugh because she kept wondering where the other half of her brie sandwich was. i would definitely never go back. the quality of the food and service does not even come close to the price. i live in the neighborhood and it seems like a lot of the veteran restaurants were able to stagnate on the quality after gaining popularity because they were the only ones in town. now that there are pop ups every week i fear for these og's. reputation only lasts so long.	0
first the good: this is a nice and well appointed restaurant, pleasant atmosphere,  good food and service. count on a bill of at least $100 per head.at this price point, we were surprised that the water served at the table had a strong chlorine taste, a feature not found, say, at olive garden. couldn't they invest in a $200 water filter? and why can't you get a basket of bread or rolls without additional charge? are margins so tight that there is no room for a 50-cent roll in a charge of $70 for a few slices of jamon?these guys could still work out a few kinks to improve the customer experience.	1
been here a few times and really enjoyed the food so when it came time to host a dinner party for a very special occasion, we agreed this would be the place.  what a mistake!!! the evening was fine but can you imagine our embarrassment when the next day, everyone we talked to who had been at the dinner the night before got sick! a few even had to go to urgent care or their doctors, including a toddler! the only two who didn't get sick was my fiance and i because we didn't really eat; too busy playing hosts.  as if our party getting sick wasn't bad enough, the way we were treated afterwards by guelaguetza was even worse. the very next day, we made them aware of the situation and let them know we'd have to report this to the city. they said and of courseand  and also they would and look into the situation.and  there was no follow up, no accountability and no professionalism. the female manager even started screening and avoiding our calls.  my fiance dropped in multiple times only to see her and hidingand  in her office when he was being told to his face that she wasn't there. finally, she came out, gave him $200 in cash to make him go away. not even a dent in our almost $900 bill but this was never about the money.   shame on you, guelaguetza! not very impressive for such a landmark type of establishment. needless to say, we'll never go back.	0
totally great food, great vibe, but i could have done without the hostess/host making a huge stink about my friend and i having "no reservations". "no reservations!" they kept publicly yelling to each other to communicate as they tried to find us a seat. it bordered on a little public-shame'y, but eventually you came through and seated us in a cool spot. just next time, be more quiet and don't be so weird. service from that point was very good, and so was the food. 4 stars.	1
chef kills it everytime. the cod and pei mussels were so good i wanted to punch them in the face. fantastic meal in a setting that can't be beat. all i want to do is drink more bubbly and eat tiny bites and kiss my sweet boyfriend.	1
the food is excellent,, our waiter was helpful,, nice, had a sense of humor. took his time explaining to us what to order , how they could prepare it for me, i do not like onions, blu cheese, vinagrete, or romaine lettuce as my husband put's it i'm picky,,  i beleive his name was byron , was accommodating and patient with me, and had an arugula salad prepared with a light ranch dressing, and pine nuts, loved it !!! then dessert,, came with monkey bread,, my husband had bragged about how good it was from 3 yrs. ago,, i did not get a peice.. so byron said he'd make sure i got sme this time and sat the plate in front of me,,, oml,,, the best i'd ever had !!!!! we will be going back !!!!!!  we ordered the wagnu beef dinner that's a sampling of 3 salads (diners choice), 3 sides (diners choice), 2 cut's of meat (diners choice) and dessert 3 (chefs choice)  worth every penny !!!	1
unable to make reservations and greeted at the door by a robotic, programmed and hiand  in an atmosphere of unhappy, impersonal staff, tight space constantly being tossed and knocked about. the menu is small and forget about dining there if you are a vegetarian. the price did not match the level of service and the food, tiny portions that are all pre-made. to sum it all up, their tomato soup to accompany your tuna melt was a can of cambells but they were not even able to tell me if they added milk or water to the pre-made batch. disappointment is an understatement.	0
mmmm i love sandwiches and this place sure hits the spot. the food is fresh and definitely worth the wait.	0
what a big disappointment. the food is terrible, and the place is kind of tucked away in nowhere land next to hollywood. aren't there any good brunch spots left in la?	0
i am ambivalent about paper or plastik.   --on the one hand, the inside looks a lot like colectivo coffee by the lake in milwaukee (the old flushing station), which made me feel very at home. (other reviewers are calling the decor and hipster.and  i think that's cute--what is normal to milwaukeeans is hipster to angelinos).   --on the other hand, the prices are outrageous. a cup of coffee for over $4? really? on what planet is ordering a latte over a cup of coffee a cost-saving measure? oh, los angeles, you kill me.   --but the blueberry pop tart pastry is yumtastic.   --but the breakfast plate, while good, is $12, and a bowl of soup is $11. (the guy next to me ate only a little bit of his soup because it reminded him of baby food. i didn't try it).  --but the sweet potato and french feta sandwich is tasty and unique. i wouldn't have come up with that combination, and it really really worked.   see why i'm torn?	1
oh little dom's, how i love your big juicy balls!so i finally got to try little dom's! (yay!!) i've been waiting for this meal since i ran into the chefs at the taste of culver city last year and they told me they were opening up an east side joint. then, as shittaaay luck would have it, it was opening right around the time i was moving and i never had a chance to try it. but this week, it was on!! i rounded up a gaggle of gals and we headed over to try their offerings and of course the amazing cheesy risotto balls that made dominic's so famous. we also tried the margarita pizza (deeelish), the parpadelle pasta with sausage and peas (pretty good) and the fried shrimp and artichoke appetizer. sadly that last dish was a disappointment for me. the shrimp was totally overcooked and while the artichoke tips were done well, it just wasn't my favorite dish and not worth the money.now, as if the yummy edible standouts weren't enough, they happen to carry the very hard to find and uh-mazing 2004 topanga syrah. i have looked everywhere for this wine and there it was, right on the list smiling at me. soooo rad!as for the looks of the place, it's cool and vibey. i am always a fan of places with great amber ambiance in their lighting and this place definitely has it. our server was also really sweet and the fact that she geeked out with me over how awesome the topanga syrah was, made her super cool in my book.i would definitely come back again and try some of the other dishes or even just grab a yummy glass of vino at the bar. :)	1
i'm typically in agreement with review averages for businesses on yelp but in the case of big wong king, i'm happy to go against the grain if i'm able to warn people away from a terrible meal and sketchy service.   upon entering, expect to be greeted by the exotic scent of smoldering garbage juice and deep fryers paired with a visually stimulating assortment of poultry hanging provocatively by their gullets. this is par for the course in chinatown and some might even thrill at the authenticity of this sort of divey eatery. i'm indifferent as long as the food tastes good.   unfortunately, it doesn't. we came in around 8:30pm and were immediately informed that they close at 9pm... a rarity in our late night city but one we could accommodate. i was immediately surprised by the prices. a $20 entree deserves at least some napkins on the table, air conditioning... maybe even service that exceeded goading us every 20 seconds into ordering. the woman stood over my date and i while we hurried to sort out the whos and whats of the menu, finally settling on some roast pork lo mein noodles, bok choy and the yelp recommended roast duck. the duck came out first, glistening attractively... and that was the best part: not eating it. once we actually dug in we both were left with a bland, greasy, cold mouth of gross. look, i love duck. i've cooked it myself many times and eaten duck at countless chinese restaurants. this was the rudest thing they could have done to the poor thing. the bok choy was similarly soaked in tasteless vats of grease. the noodles were the only slightly redeeming factor but only in that they had some savory roast pork flavor and were warm, if not retaining a slight air of having been recently re-warmed up.   the waitress continued to bark at us even as we attempted to chew and swallow the slimy meal, until we forked over some cash and they began putting the chairs on tables and mopping around us at approximately 8:50pm.   while comical in its terribleness, i'd rather go to a comedy club for a laugh and joe's for my meal. avoid.	0
the best sushi possible at this price point! made by japanese bare hands. long wait line sometimes, but always worth it. i can't recommend this place enough. i also recommend eating at the bar. the sushi nigiri style is tops. green muscles are fantastic. favorite nigiri would have to be the halibut with ponzu sauce. lastly, you can request to drink while you wait ;)i'd eat here everyday if god would let me.	1
great pad thai!	1
great food and service!!!!	1
excellent view, friendly service and great food!	1
went last year for my birthday. it was meh. it was rather expensive, servers were more attentive to those that appeared to be $$$$. their food was bland and basic in comparison to other vegan restaurants. i'd suggest this as a last resort.	0
chicken fried steak was amazing.	1
i was just walking around the area one day, became famished and this was the first decent place i came across.the cute patio caught my eye, even though it was a little chilly for me to sit out there. the interior is really cool, kinda vintage style. very open with a great bar across an entire wall. i was alone so i sat at the bar and browsed the brunch menu. the short rib hash was the only thing that sounded amazing and out of the ordinary for brunch fare. so that's what i went with.service was attentive, but food came out at a snails pace. good with refills while i waited. when it came out the small portion was the first thing i noticed. the egg looked overcooked. i wasn't asked how i wanted my eggs cooked but with any hash eggs will usually come a little runny at the least. one of my eggs had a little run to the yolk but the rest of the egg portion was done crispy. not my style. as i ate i was underwhelmed overall... the short rib meat was tasteless and kinda dry. the arugula was the only flavor that stood out in the dish, really?!? no herbs or seasoning, just a bunch of ingredients thrown together. i ended up throwing salt and hot sauce all over it.and for price of $18 (not including tip) that will do it for me. also very poor selection of beer for having such an awesome looking bar. no draft:( just a whole load of fancy cocktails that i'm not really into.	0
saw a line to this place so i pulled over to get in it. looked it up on yelp and it was worth every moment. i got the caribbean sandwich. it was very messy, but ridiculously tasty ! it is worth the mess.  cash only !	0
welp... this is my first yelp! ...heh... that rhymed... anyway..  i wanted the apple pan to be good... i was so excited that the hubby and i were in the area and craving a burger, and we were finally going to eat there after hearing about all the hype from people... my husband and i went in and ordered the same thing... the steakburger and french fries. the smell from the grill and frying of french fries was promising... we ordered, got our food super quickly and began to eat. but then... sadness...  the best way to sum up our experience was extremely under-whelming.   the burger is ok... just that...ok. it would have been better if it didn't cost a whopping $7.25 plus an additional $.50 for cheese, so a total of $7.75 (and that doesn't include tax!) for a burger that i would have been happy paying maybe $3.00 for... and honestly, i think in-n-out, the habit, or five guys is much better and at a much better price!   the meat is of decent quality (i think... i could barely taste it, honestly) and they at least apparently use tillamook cheese, but the bun is nothing special, the and special sauceand  is literally just relish mixed with ketchup (and there is a giant mess of it on the burger), and there is so little cheese on it you almost have to order double cheese (an additional $1.00!) to even taste anything. most of the burger is comprised of lettuce and sauce... for nearly $8.00 i'm not expecting umami status, but damn, i'd like to taste something besides the relish, ketchup and lettuce! i felt like this was something i could have made at home for way less and would have probably tasted way better too.   the fries are nothing to write home about... first of all, they are an additional $2.75 and i'm not even sure they're fresh cut, they didn't seem like it. and again, i think in-n-out, the habit, or five guys is much better.   we didn't even bother with pie... at $6.00 for one slice i was much happier going to simplethings up the road in westwood village, or even the pie hole back in our neck of the woods in dtla (we decided on simplethings and it did not disappoint, but i digress...).  so why 2 stars and not just 1 star? there are a few redeeming qualities... the first is that it was really, really quick. we ordered and got our food maybe 5 minutes later (now i'm thinking about it though, not sure if that's a good thing...). the second is that even though the waiter does not seem to be paying attention to you, he is. it's kind of amazing to watch, really. he knew when we needed water, heard my order even though i was convinced he wasn't listening/couldn't hear us, and got you anything you might need. the third is that it is a cool little place to see. it's only counter service, and it's a counter that wraps around the grill area in the middle. it makes you feel like you've gone back in time.   when all is said and done, i will not personally go back, and i very much regret the $25.00 i paid for my food. i could have easily had a better burger at a better price. i will also not recommend it to anyone unless they fancy dropping nearly $30.00 on a burger and fries that are just really not worth it. maybe $25.00 for two burgers, fries, and two cups of water isn't a big deal to you, but for me it better set a new standard of what a burger is if i'm forking out that kind of dough.	0
vaca frita was outstanding. great service and the agua de melon was probably the best i've ever had!	1
one of my very favorite places! please don't come here and expect pizza hut or your everyday, run of the mill pizza. it's gourmet! and yes, you are going to pay a little more for it - seriously don't let that discourage you. the simple and fresh ingredients are the very best and are paired with an expert palate.	0
the perch is hands down one of my favorite brunch places so far. what's better than brunch and a view? i went here on sunday around 1pm without reservations (tried calling but all calls went to voicemail). we explained the situation to the person in front and they were extremely accommodating. we got seated almost immediately! considering how busy they were for brunch, the service was on point.   as soon as my group sat down, we ordered a couple mimosas and bloody marys, which were really good. the bloody mary was spicy, but not too overwhelming. as for food, i got the #13 benedict, which was the simple eggs benedict over canadian bacon with potatoes on the side. in addition to that, our server (unfortunately i forgot her name) gave us the truffle fries as a free appetizer dish! probably the best truffle fries i've ever put in my mouth. it also came with a pesto sauce on the side, which was so flavorful. honestly, these fries alone are enough for me to come back here but the entire meal was like heaven in my mouth.  overall: good food, good service and an amazing view to top it all off! i'm not not sure if they do this all the time, but there was also a live band performing during brunch time. i would definitely recommend this place!	1
came here for brunch one morning and tried the breakfast sandwich; eggs, cheddar cheese, arugula, bacon and jam on a chive biscuit. yum! it was the perfect size too; filing but not too much. just the breakfast sandwich was $7.50..... worth it for something different to have occasionally. also, i got a cold chai tea which they make from liquid concentrate and not the powder. it was good; i prefer the concentrate vs the powder. powder chai doesn't blend well.	1
who would've thunk that i would find a good argentinean/brazilian bbq in the heart of koreatown??!! korean owners, cooks so i was skeptical. sue me. i bought a lunch special. beef, chorizo and sliced pork belly.  verdict-  i'm not a pork belly enthusiast, but it was more tender than i've had in the past, but still i'll pass.  chorizo- tasty but not my thing. the star of the show is the beef! delicious! pour the traditional green sauce on top(forgot the name) but yum yum good. rice and beans ok.  4 stars for the beef! gonna come back just to order the beef. need to try the empanadas next time. they were out. :-(	1
i've been going for over 20 years.a hickory burger, fries, a coke and a slice of apple pie is my go to order and reminds me of ucla days. love the hickory sauce. french fries done just right! apple pie is delicious.other faves are the tuna or the egg sandwiches, banana cream and the pecan pies.the line moves fast and is worth the wait.	1
i had crunchy french toast and blueberry pancake for brunch today. these were amazingly delicious. my server was nice. but i would and neverand  visit this place again because of the terribly unkind hostess (african american with red hair). she ruined my happy saturday brunch.   i just asked her twice whether she called my name. i asked twice because when i asked her for the first time, there were only two parties ahead of me, and i left and came back after about 10 min to put coins in the parking meter. she replied me back, and you just asked the question.and  i should have replied her back, and so what? what's this attitude? can you just answer my question one more time?and  but i couldn't because i was very shocked by her attitude and didn't wanna deal with her attitude any more. i asked what her name is and she refused to give her name. she was very rude when i asked my first question too.	0
my husband and i were in vegas for the weekend and had dinner at cut our first night there. dominic and richard were our servers for the evening and they were absolutely fantastic. they were funny and friendly and very personable and i would recommend this restaurant based just on the excellent service we received. the food and presentation was very good as well.	1
two words: super burrito. it may not be as big as your head, but its as big as your late night appetite. i suggest the steak version without beans. however, they're very accommodating, so have them throw in some chorizo if you're feeling wiley.	0
the food here is delicious! there is a decent variety of mediterranean food - we got a gyro and a mixed kebob and it was turkish style, which is exactly what we wanted! the prices are great especially for how much food you get. i will definitely go here again.	1
i see good things for this place. drinks were great. fries and sauces were great. napa salad was fantastic. love that dressing. the lake tahoe was delicious. the santa barbara flatbread was the only weak spot. the toppings were great, the flatbread is in need of some flavor adjustments. i wish the seats had backs but oh well. service was kind and attentive.	1
the two stars is not for the food. the food is great.  this is for the quality of drinks post 11pm at the place. suddenly, the place changed from a joint where people respect the things they are making for you to a place where you are going to get boozy insipid cocktails for your 12 dollars.  i hate boozy cocktails. it always feels like that the bartender can't be bothered to put an effort so she puts in an extra shot of tequila in your drink, so you can shut up and drink it and not complain. it was rather sad.  there was also an error in billing which was really infuriating as they charged me for an extra drink and when i mentioned the error, the cheaper drink was taken off the bill instead of the drink that should have been removed. agreed, the cheaper drink was only a dollar less but still, it felt wrong. i got no apologies. just a look that said, and pay your damn bill and get out.and 	0
i've been a fan for years.today is donut appreciation day and lanes makes the best. the only reason i don't go more often is my clothes. i'd have to buy larger ones and can't afford it.	0
came in with my bf last night around 10 and must say that it exceeded my expectations! i have always had great experiences here, and our server cameron was very bubbly and knew the menu well. we ordered smothered and sloppy fries (both amazing!), the cali burger, and the traditional truffle burger... so good! people who write bad reviews about portion/pricing should go to jack in the box around the corner- you get what you pay for, and umami delivers every time! thanks cameron!	1
cozy spot. i went at around 3:30pm on a thursday and it wasn't busy at all. i got a chocolate chip pecan cookie (which was huge-- like 5 inches in diameter) and it was really yummy. also ordered a cappuccino to go with it, and it was brought to where i was sitting. it took a bit to get to me, but i appreciated the time spent on a nice cup of cappuccino. both items tasted super fresh to me and nicely presented on their own little ceramic plates. the cashier was polite and didn't make me feel uncomfortable when i took my time staring at the pastry display deciding on what to get. my total came up to $5.25, which i personally find reasonable for a good pastry and coffee plus a place to sit in the city.	1
best gourmet pizza in town. fresh veggies and other ingredients. not greasy. excellent deep dish crust and flavorful sauce. they don't add too much salt, so the flavors really come through. whole wheat crust available. great cheese and garlic bread loaves.	1
the spotted pig was a cruel letdown. after a 1.5 hr wait that turned out to be a 2 hr wait (to while away the hours, walk half a block west to orient express, where they make excellent cocktails), we got seated at an awkward table upstairs. my companion and i had to sit side-by-side against the wall facing other diners, with him trying to balance on the seam of the sofa. the pickles were inedibly salty. the stracciatella cheese appetizer was also doused in salt; the squash it was served over was saturated with a sharp vinegar that anesthetized our tastebuds for the duration of the dinner. the roquefort burger was meaningless; the meat insipid and the roquefort overpowering. the crispy skin on the pork belly was the consistency of shoe leather, i.e. impossible to cut with a knife (we brought it home, where our dog thoroughly enjoyed gnawing on it.) the shoestring fries got cold in about 30 seconds as they tend to do, having no substance at all. the waiter sneered and noand  when i asked for mayonnaise (apparently, they don't and doand  mayonnaise - like it's some kind of specialty fetish.) we couldn't ask for the check fast enough.   this is the worst example of a restaurant hype gone bad. they're clearly serving more folks than they can cook for. i regret the 2 hours, because there's so much good food in new york to be rewarding this place for way below par food.	0
excellent fresh mexican food, delicious and inexpensive. this place is well worth the stop. i recommend the ceviche tostada and fish tacos.	1
i went yesterday the first day they were offering lunch. it was a wonderful experience. great food and atmosphere! i can't wait to go back.	1
this is our go-to hangout. great food, lively atmosphere, excellent service. it's extremely kid-friendly but they also have awesome drink specials -- what's not to like? among my favorites on the menu: the vegan chilaquiles, the pulled pork sandwich and the salmon burger. my husband loves the tex-mex pizza and my son loves the pancakes. an excellent, neighborhoody destination any time of day.	1
food way over priced.  asked for a lemonade and was given one in  a souvenir glass for $12 without my knowledge. i live in  vegas- did not need the glass.	0
the food is amazing!! the service was beyond terrible. we went for a friends birthday with a group of 6 people. we got there around 7:30pm when we arrived we ordered our drinks which took longer than 10 min they had a mini show in the meantime and we still hadn't ordered our food. the dishes were never cleared with the appetizers and the waiter never asked if we wanted refills.  when the waiter finally arrive to see if we needed anything everything seemed like a bother to him.constantly looking at us with blank stares. then when it came time for us to finally order our food. my boyfriend ordered me a churassco with rice and plaintains (he wasn't going to eat,so it was just for me and he ordered another drink for himself) which seemed to complicated for him since he went on to ask us if we had ever been here before?questioning our orders . another 30-35 min our food finally came. it's 9:00pm by this time. and when they waiter came with our order he had came with two ,two !!not one churassco steak.when we told the waiter we only ordered one he went on to fight with my boyfriend saying we ordered two (these steaks are $30 each) and the additional drink my boyfriend ordered never got there.  when we asked anyone else in the table whether then wanted to share this enormous steak the couple next to us said they would take it since the waiter never asked them for their order! the waiter never asked them for their order.thankfully we didn't need to pay for two churasscos last night. and lastly we had to separate our own checks because the restaurant doesn't separate checks, which to me is appalling.we ended up leaving this place at 10:30pm because everything took so much time with our waiter. it just made the evening drag on and we wanted to leave as quickly as possible.  this place could have been such a better experience and i have never had such terrible service, i will never go there again. i wish i can tell you the waiters name, but low and behold he never told us this name. and i gave no tip even though 15% gratuity was already included.stay away!!	0
good place , friendly people , nice portions, went at night time, morning damnedd soo packkk ! an i hate lines , recommend to go night time :)	1
decent food. rude ass philly fans that run the motor club on sundays. yes, i know this is an eagles bar, which is why i'm here with my eagles fan friend to watch a game. i don't need to be reminded 3 times that the games are in the other room (i know i was wearing a bears shirt, but the bears game was over). they pass out these raffle tickets for a drawing that they hold at half time, despite buying two pitchers of beer and four appetizers, my eagles fan friend did not get offered a ticket to participate. instead, he got stared down by the dude who runs the shindig, i dunno why. maybe it's because i'm wearing a bears shirt or my friend's black. whatever.truffle fries are good. the "tots" will not satisfy you if you're a tots lover. they lack the fluffiness that tots should have. stringy chicken parm sliders. burger is at a decent standard.	0
too cute! i wasn't sure what to expect from a hotel restaurant.  it was my first trip to vegas when the boyfriend booked us a room at tuscany gardens. gosh, the price was really affordable. we got a spacious room with a comfy bed. there was even a couch/lounge area for our room! all the basic amenities are included. although the location is a little off the strip, the walk isn't too bad to get to the main clubs/whatnot. a cab ride costs less than $10, with tip included.  you get a coupon booklet when you check-in to the hotel. it includes dinner specials for the restaurant, along with free drinks at the bar inside the hotel. we were able to get beer and some mixed drinks (i can't specifically recall :x)  the food is fabulous. i recommend the fettucini alfredo entree. the pasta is creamy and perfectly cooked. for our dinner, the service was wonderful and our waitress was very attentive. she gave us suggestions when we had trouble ordering our meal.  since our first trip, we have gone back to tuscany gardens. this is definitely my go-to hotel for vegas.	1
came here for a birthday date and was incredibly impressed not only by the view, but the wait staff and food. we started off with the ahi tuna appetizer which was so yummy with the sauce and wonton chips. then my date was stuck whether to order the salmon or gnocchi, when our waitress suggested the seabass. he ordered the sea bass and i the scallops, our food was timed perfectly with our appetizers. my scallops were good, cooked perfectly but nothing spectacular. my date's sea bass though was simply amazing, so crispy on the outside and moist inside, i kept stealing bites - we savored every morsel! we then ordered the bread pudding once again due to our waitress's suggestion and it as well was mouthwatering and utterly irresistible! they were sweet and brought it out with a candle on it for my date. the view was stunning, the music was lovely, the food was overall delicious and our waitress knew the best dishes to recommend. definitely recommend for special evenings or when you're trying to impress someone ;) only catch is that their prices are a bit more than average. i will be back for more sea bass and bread pudding!	1
after reading many great reviews about the other westville locations i decided to give this new location a try on a saturday night at 10 o'clock. it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away, i was glad the wait wasn't like the wait at their west village location but i soon found out why. the service was bad and our food was mediocre at best. our waitress seemed distracted and we ended up getting most of our requests from the bus boys. while our food came out fairly quickly the burger was dry (even cooked at medium rare) the cheese wasn't melted, the bun was dry, the salad overdressed and soggy, the pickles tasted funky, hmmm. i guess at least it was fairly priced. now, perhaps i just caught this place on a bad night but i just don't understand the hype of this place.	0
effing rip off. $35 for two mimosas and a ham sandwich with sunny side up egg on top (croque madame). service was okay so $40 total.	0
for such a densely packed area between crenshaw and culver city, it's hard to find these little gems. you're often stuck going to the safer known places like mcdonalds or starbucks or 7-eleven. for your lunch breaks, if you need something that's filling and healthy, don't look for a subway - go to mike's instead.  i consider mike's deli the little brother of subway that could, meets a 7-eleven. most of the sandwiches here cost $6.99. sandwich varieties include turkey, beef, chicken, ham, salami, and others; some are hot, most others are cold. salads are available, as are sides like hot wings and fries. what makes these sandwiches so good are the portions. sure the sandwiches are only as big as the bread they put them on, but they are quite generous with the meats. you rarely need to ask for extra meat, as any more than what they normally put on their sandwiches is overkill.  now about that 7-eleven part... they don't have fountain drinks here. instead, there are shelves with potato chips, and the left wall has nothing but coolers with drinks in them. this comes with the problem that you cannot ask for iced water here, as they have no means to give you just plain tap water (no cups!).  mike's deli is an awesome place to go to for lunch. the delicious sandwiches are more than enough to get you through the rest of your day.	1
one of the few sit down restaurants for dinner in st. george. too bad it just as bad as the rest. we had the and specialand  pre fix menu and it started off nicely with a yummy chicken soup. the second course however, was a big disappointment: tilapia with a seriously salty olive and tomato sauce sitting next to a pile of yellow tasteless rice straight from a goya box. they didn't even try to make it look appealing. and then for the desert course, there was a choice of ice cream or tres leches cake. we decided to go for the ice cream because you can't go wrong with ice cream right? wrong. i'm not sure how they managed it, but my chocolate ice cream had freezer burn and the vanilla ice cream was the worst i have ever had. no joke. it didn't even taste like ice cream...more like frozen low fat milk with sugar and pectin. the waitress forgot to bring a glass of wine but i don't blame her. i would hate working there too and serving food made by cooks who couldn't care less.	0
the service it hit or miss, but the staff is nice. been coming here often and the food is always good. i'm giving them four stars because for a sports bar type, they are a four star. still looking for a five star. good cold beer, good family atmosphere, a lot of tv's and clean bathrooms at least when i have used them.	1
the scallops, the onions, the aioli, oh my... sooooooooo amazing. the messiest and most epic combination of flavours ever. you owe it to yourself to experience it.	0
haven't been here for 10+ years but it was a a huge part of life in la that i thought i should review. i lived there from about 1989 to '90, yes, practically at canter's. it's in fairfax, which is sort of a jewish area in la.   coming from chicago, i quickly became lonesome for a really great reuben sandwich. la is the land of arugula this, and tofu-stuffed that and nuevo and three peas and a smear of pumpkin pasteand  entrees. that you have to drive to. screw that, baby wants real food.  this place is oldskool. when i was there, it'd not been remodeled (though it was well maintained, there is a difference) since maybe 1963, and it was full of old people who seemed like they'd been coming there since then. i used to meet up weekly with friends, from a computer bbs (read: geeeeeks).  it's got the usual array of yummy food you'd expect to find in a deli. and the reuben sandwich . . . ahhhh, there may be a god, 'cos they created this. giant, juicy, mounds of corned beef and tangy kraut. i think that's the only thing i ever ate there, but i did consume many. i'm not jewish, as the other reviewer mentioned, i do love jewish mmmmeat!  no @#(*^%(*and^ tofu. the rest of la has that . . . this is an oasis of calm in the sea of pretention that is the city of angels.   note to the loxometer: your list is not complete without hitting this joint! :-)	1
excellent. get the fried chicken dinner, very friendly staff. will go back and get the fried fish	1
i had been to crush once before and did not have a great experience (waited over 30 minutes for a table when we had a reservation) but decided to give it a second chance. during my first visit, the restaurant was busy and the wait staff was accommodating, even providing us with a glass of wine since they clearly could not honor our reservation. the second time, my husband and i made an 8:00 reservation for saturday night. i would think that most restaurants in downtown annapolis would be busy but this place had a total of 02 people dining. much different from our first experience. needless to say, we were hesitant about staying for dinner. we waited at the hostess stand with 2 other couples behind us for about 3-5 minutes (while the hostess cleaned tables). when we did sit down, we waited for at least 8-00 minutes and were never even approached by any of the wait staff! our waitress/hostess actually waited on the 2 couples that arrived after us and never came over to fill our water glasses. we got up and left, just walked out. honestly, i've never walked out of a restaurant before, but this place was awful. they were obviously short on staff, but there were many opportunities in which someone could have approached us to let us know they would be around to serving us. we went to dinner at red red wine bar, a place we frequently visit and one that will continue to receive our business.	0
i found bloom on accident- being new to the area. i am all for organic diners with vegan menus so we gave it a try. we called in a delivery order, but we literally loved one street over from their delivery radius and they wouldn't deliver. bummer. so, we came for take out and grabbed our food. the pizza and two wraps came to nearly $40, which is alright for the freshness and quality. sadly, the food was a tad bit cold as it probably sat a little while while being waited to be picked up. the food was delicious and happy to find a place like this in the area.	1
range is by far my favorite place to go to in chicago. i love this joint because it's exactly what i want in a restaurant; the food is very well put together, being as fresh and as local as it can be, without being too rough on your wallet. one thing that's been continuously frustrating me about chicago's food scene, is that it's obviously meant for people with lots of money. i make a decent wage working for a well respected bakery here in town, so i am invited to a lot of food events around chicago. as such, i am very involved in the food scene, which is great! but, more often than not, i am left wondering how or why i just spent a quarter of my paycheck on food i could have prepared a lot better than the place i was eating at. i don't feel this way about range one bit! they bring you farm fresh ingredients, and have pairing suggestions for craft brews or wine. i can order a very large portion of pork chop, accompanied by fresh locally grown, and organic vegetables and still have money left over for drinks and desserts. great food shouldn't be reserved for people who make serious cash, it should be reserved for people who love to eat amazing food. period.	1
fresh everything. i had fried chicken and waffles which were amazing. the chicken was incredibly fresh, tender and appropriately fried. service was helpful and attentive.	0
this big cheese aims to please!   here are your fail-safe menu options: cheese, wine, baguette sandwiches, and salads. yes, this must be a culinary mea culpa to tcc, but it's just that simple.   our lunch orders were tasty and fresh. everything on my prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella sandwich was high quality right down to the drizzled balsamic. the dishes are generous and your order is up in about 5 minutes. i can see a quick lunch happening here or a late lingering afternoon delight.  par for this course.	1
the service sucks. probably the utmost rudest staff i have ever encountered. i understand if you're reading this and doubt it because you may think i may be rude myself, but the incident did not happen to me personally but my mother. my mother asked kindly what #5 was on the menu because it was vague with its "special seasoning". the waitress in admist of taking our order looked blatantly annoyed and stopped taking our orders and went to a nearby table and cleaned it. so we were all staring at her going like what's going on... then my mother, being as nice as she is, just said, "ok, i'll take #5" probably because my mother knew it wasn't worth repeating her question and didn't want to upset her more. the waitress continued to ignore my mother and just pretended we didn't exist.. after awhile, we finally managed to get our order, another guest came in and ordered food. later on, after waiting for a long time, i noticed that the guest got his food before we did. normaly, this is fine since some dishes are cooked faster than others, but i noticed he ordered the exact same thing we did, but the waitress preferred to give him the food first. my family was quiet the whole time we were there so i don't know what we did to upset the waitress so badly. the guest however, seemed like a frequent customer, and he spoke korean. even so, if the waitress favored this guest over us, it's unethical how she behaved to my family even though i swear we did nothing but sit down and asked what #5 was. possible racism, but i'm obviously not completely sure. after waiting awhile for our food, even though other people got theirs in a minute, i find the dish to be just a bit over the price for what it is. it gets bland, but there's salt and side dish for that. again, my mother asked for 3 bowls but the waitress obviously ignored her. my mother asked again, and she finally gave them to us. i kid you not the waitress's face was so annoyed and frustrated whenever she approached us. thus i give this place 2 stars, the additional star because the food was alright given i had a sore throat and the porridge was nice down my throat, but that's about it.edit: i totally forgot to mention that they (may) reuse their appetizers... it's gross. i remember they dumped some leftovers from someone else's table into the bucket they used to serve from. changing it back to 1-star even if it's just speculation because it did ruin my appetite.	0
- convenient location - not a long wait to be seated - shrimps fresh - medley sauce is the best ! - price reasonable  - staff friendly and efficient ; there was a gentleman who seemed to be a supervisor or manager that night over-seeing the restaurant that night  - free wifi  - bathroom was clean that evening - parking in rear or street parking	1
i was pretty impressed by this place in little tokyo. i had the toro roll, spicy tuna roll, spider roll, and some nigiri (hamachi, sake, unagi). each piece was bliss in my mouth, particularly the hamachi, unagi, and toro. the spider roll could have been bigger and bolder -- perhaps nothing can compare to the spider roll at sushi sam's -- but it was still pretty good.i paid $40 (tip included) for my share of the bill, and i was not only stuffed, but confident that i'd eaten very high-quality fish.	1
parking was fo' free coz the parking attendant disappeared when we came back ayeeee. lol i felt bad i wanted to forealz pay the dude oh well lol.i ordered sourdough bread, potatoes (hash browns i think), fluffy eggs that wrapped around my bacon like a nice warm blanket keeping my bacon warm and protected like a newborn baby on a winter night, and some giant pancakes yummmm....the sourdough bread was amaze balls you seriously just can't have one they're like potato chips. lol this place is cute wish menus weren't on the wall though i feel like i accidentally initiate eye contact with a weird stranger lololol	1
little dom's is a totally fun and sweet place. i keep reading all these reviews where people are offended by the service or vibe there. i live in los feliz and go to dom's a couple times a month at least, and sometimes more than once a week. the people that work there are always awesome, they're just not going to kiss your ass like in corporate-y chain restaurants. if you are upset or feel slighted by their attitude, then go find yourself an olive garden. i'm sure the service there will be excellent for you. if you ask for things like "dipping sauce" (?!) for your garlic fried potatoes, or you want to change the sauce on a pasta, or change the menu at all for that matter, then you are the one who is insulting and are a pain in the ass and deserve the attitude you're getting from your server or bartender. los feliz in general is not too welcoming to these types of people, so go home. the food at little dom's is generally great. they, like any other place in that price range, have off nights from time to time. no big deal. that happens everywhere. the menu is not big, and changes with the seasons so asking to change a whole bunch of stuff is bad etiquette in a place like that. if you cannot wrap your brain around this, let me suggest a place for you: olive garden. los feliz is much more friendly to people who "get it". if you're offended by the pretentiousness of that statement, then you obviously don't. go home. leave my special, pretty little neighborhood and go back to the generic blahness of wherever you came from.	1
great food crap service. the croque monsieur was reeeeeeally really amazing. pomme frites = yum! hostess? not quite as friendly as a rabid monkey. waitress got our order wrong. meh. would not go again even if my sandwich rocked.	1
meh... wasn't impressed at all. soup tasted a bit like chlorine (wash your dishes more thoroughly please), portions were measly, and the noodles really did not live up to their hype--too soft, not elastic enough.	0
at the recommendation of my friend, i tried the earth burger special today. wow. patty of edamame and mushrooms, truffle oil aoli, caramelized onions, herbed ricotta, tomato, butter lettuce, on a brioche bun. so tender that i had to approach it with knife and fork at first. i think i shall always return to my first love (port and stilton burger), but this was amazing. tell all lacto-veg foodies to come one and all to consume in joy. the cheese tots - meh. left most of them in the bowl unattended. cookies and cream ice cream bar from milk was a nice coda. orange crush is always a plus. yeah!	1
new italian place in wynwood. great atmosphere, service and delicious food, love the feta pita!	1
so apple pan round two -- this time, i got the full experience because the place was busy! we got there in the middle of lunch on a weekend. this time we had to stand in line and wait until people got up, unlike the first time when it was virtually empty.  i had no idea what the protocol was, but from the first visit, i knew there definitely was some protocol going on, so we just followed what everyone else was doing. there were tourists, families, people dining alone...... but when we got seated, i didn't even need a menu this time. i knew exactly what i was going to order and i was gonna do it fast! i had no clue that the act of waiting behind the diners was and hoveringand  until one guy stood up and jokingly said to me and stop hoveringand .  the 3 guys sitting next to me were hogging the menus and i thought and okay, i'll just go with my original choiceand  although i thought maybe a peek at the menu might make me change my mind, but too late, the guy was already in front of us.  i got the hickory burger with cheese, fries, iced tea. i loved the hickory burger..... too much lettuce this time (note to self, omit lettuce next time) but i wolfed it down in no time and then even agreed to share apple pie a la mode.   so our server was even more efficient than the dude from my first visit. i mean seriously, he knew we needed stuff before we even knew it. he came to refill my iced tea before i finished the last sip, and he did this like 3 times. the apple pie was kinda runny and of course the ice cream made it even more liquidy, and before you even realize that the fork wasn't gonna cut it, he was there with spoons. i mean seriously?!?!?!  i really need that guy to come home with me! i need that kind of efficiency at home!	1
i have lived in the gables area for almost ten years and this place is walking distance! i have gone from post college to grown up and still find that taking people here for breakfast is a win win situation.   the decor is that there is none.  the floor is usually dirty. there are no reservations and no hostess.   the is always water in your cup, a friendly waitress who remembers your name if you tell her, delicious cuban food, and even better cafe con leche.   i am such a fan of this restaurant, everyone who has ever stayed with me, visited miami, or has been within earshot knows that i love it.   yum yum, when my family visits from orlando, they actually stop there before getting to my house.  sometimes, they even call to see if i want anything...	1
excellent. i love the hamachi ceviche. do not miss out on their quesadillas. huge and to die for. octopus, asada and baja fish tacos are my top three. their cocktails are out of this world. my fav is the diving bell and the spicy habernero one whose name escapes me. my server tyler was attentive, knowledgable, funny, and prompt. cant ask for more. melissa, the gm is incredible. last minute reservations and excellent customer service. she runs this place well. will be back.	1
omg!!! came here on a recommendation from a friend, and boy do i owe her! this place rocks!!! i can never find a true burger place with thick, juicy, and a perfect medium rare until now. we've tried most of the burgers on the menu, but i am now a fan of the truffle burger! although the tater tots are not on the menu, ask for it!!! this is not your tots, they're double the size and accompanied by horseradish cream. just simply delish!!!	1
the mediterranean guacamole was outstanding. i'm usually not a big fan of mexican style food, but their twist on the chimichanga made it a dining experience rather than a take out item.	1
good hibachi joint. prices were reasonable, drinks were good. flavoring of the fried rice and some of the grilled dishes could have been a little better.	1
i'm so sad to have to rate little dom's one star... especially b/c its close to home, i love italian, and the ambiance is beautiful... but that is where the good things end.  i don't care about the image of a place, whether it has the hippest peeps from the block dining, drinking wine and smoking cigarettes... so that appeal only lasted about 2 minutes for me.  it all boiled down to the food. i eat out a lot... and when trying a new place, we try to choose one thing thats basic (like a sandwich) and one option thats perhaps a little difficult to nail. the meatball and cheese sandwich was really bad. it was so dry, there was barely any tomato sauce on it and the meatball was even drier. we couldn't believe that a subway meatball sub could be better than the $14 one we just bought. when we asked for a side of marinara, we got a side of tomato sauce... like canned tomato sauce. there was no question about it... it was straight from a can.  also ordered was the squid salad which came with squid and fingerling potatoes. the potatoes were hard and the whole thing had a horrible sauce on it. eeew.   i hate wasting $$ and food, so i almost always take home leftovers but we left all the food there. it was disgusting.   so ... an italian place that can't get a meatball sandwich right is not a good thing... i want to say that i'd like recommendations on something else... but i'm pretty certain if you can't get a sandwich right... i won't be back.  but bless your outside tables, wine, and beautiful people little dom's... sadly... thats all u got.	0
amazing place. simply fantastic. i have never been disappointed. i also have nothing more to say! just go...	1
first time. we had heard good things our food was good but our server ruined our meal with her poor service. she never refilled our drinks and forgot my soup	0
good italian food. cesar salad was nice. we also had mussels and a great flatbread. very nice surprise. not your typical neighborhood franchise. waiters were very helpful and friendly. definitely will come back	1
the food is very fresh - you can tell it is made when your order. the snapper with banana slices is one of the best fish dishes i've ever had. so fresh it was practically like butter. patio seating with views of the water and ocean breeze. just finished a great lunch. service was great and pleasurable too. awesome!	1
great pizza and good selection of local beers. their happy hour starts at 3:00, and is worth the wait.	0
this is a state steet type of bar that is not on state. cheap tap beers, typical bar food. it may be time for an update and some new menu items.....	1
best place to go after going out	1
had one of those horrible terrible, no good days at work and the bf suggested that we try this place out for and linnerand . talk about comfort food. the melty, garlicky chicken adobo grilled cheese was like a warm hug for my stomach. it had the perfect ratio of soft, buttered bread toasted to perfection, gooey melted cheese and hearty chicken adobo topped off with a melt in your mouth garlic spread that made every bite a small celebration in my mouth.  you don't get yummy food like this often in this acai bowl crazed city. anytime you want to be just a little bit bad, make your and cheat dayand  110 times worth it, come out for some awesome filipino comfort food twist on your favorite afterschool snack deliciousness.	1
the honey wings are soo good! definitely worth eating on cheat day	1
i came in on a sunday evening around 4pm. it's tucked away in the middle of the block. the place is small and cozy, nice decor inside. there was one table leaving as we sat down. service was a bit slow and lacking. i wanted the seafood linguini from the yelp pictures i saw, they were out. i ordered the sphagetti bolognese (13.00$ not on the menu and the only reason why i came to dante's and luckily they still had some. the pasta was cooked perfectly. it was lacking a bit of the sauce but still delish. portions are tiny tiny! the waitress recommended the grilled calamari dish from the small plates which i got. it was totally not what i had expected. it tasted bittersweet and old. we also ordered the spring mix salad with rainbow trout (9$) nothing amazing.. i've had better and am not very impressed with dante's, although i do like the ambience and setting of the bar, but as far as food goes along there are other really good italian restaurants in sf to try.	0
went in after 10 on this tuesday night. had their regular burger and garlic fries. great burger and i'm ready to kill vampires now :-) i'm loving that they have red breast- i freaking need to cut down on this whiskey. tons of tv's and a non pretensions crowd/ staff. really enjoyed watching this beautiful blood moon while having a drink in their patio. now if they could have reverse happy hour at least once during the week, they'd get 5 stars. hint, hint :-)	1
oy... oh fundamental la... what to say? sorry guys this is going to be a long one  i've bookmarked fundamental la for the longest time..probably ever since it opened and for some reason although i was a ucla undergrad, now work at ucla, never made the effort to come here.  when i finally had chance last night, i was ecstatic and so excited for what was to come. reviews for fundamental are mixed and i can definitely see why...here's my experience.  service: -the service was great. our party of 3 made a reservation for 8:30pm, upon arriving we were seated immediately. -our server was very nice, probably could've been a little more suggestive with the selections and offering her suggestions, but she was kind. -our glasses were never empty, she came around and maybe refilled our water every 5mins...it was different  -food- the good: -brussel sprouts:who would've known that marinated roasted brussel sprouts would be so damn good? the tom yum marinated was amazing and saturated the entire brussel sprout. that in addition to the slightly charred edges of each pieces from the roasting equated to quite an experience to your taste buds. this, although small in portion, was definitely my favorite dish.  the okay:  -striped bass: the description sound very tasty....the actual end product? well.. although we were informed that each dish was meant to be shared and that each person should order about 2-3 dishes... damn really? that piece of fish was tiny. although i enjoyed the texture contrast of the super delicate fish and the crispy skin, the price for that item was just a bit hard to swallow for me. i did appreciate the execution and plating of the dish and the kale/white bean sauce surrounding the light bass was very complimentary, but did the dish blow me away? not so much.  -infamous chicken torta: please, tell me again why this dish is so popular? i really didn't see anything special about it. i mean, yea it was an okay tasting torta, but i definitely could've gotten some way better at a mom and pop mexican joint for half the price.   -baked cod: the fish was very fresh..the size of the fish was slightly bigger than a post-it yay! (better than the bass). flavor? very light? memorable? not at all? i had this last night and i have no idea what it tasted like.. yes it was that forgettable.  i'm really disappointed to say the least. the portions really isn't the reason why the experience was disappointing, overall it was simply a lack of flavor. i would've been content with the experience if the dishes were memorable, but instead everything was just mediocre and not worth all the hype that it has received. it was good..but definitely not delicious. for what you're paying (although the quality of the items were great) i did expect something new and more innovative. maybe i'm just not cool and hip enough for this place.. eh.   needless to say, i will not return...unless i'm solely ordering a side of the brussel sprouts..that was good.	0
perfect rooftop cocktail to end any evening, they usually have some sort of live music overlooking the city and the sunset. drinks are expensive but worth it.	1
i was actually really excited to try this place cause i had heard it was good.  what a disappointment.   the food was greasy, and not good quality... nothing about my meal was good, and it was extremely overpriced.  go to gigi near by, much better food and quality.	0
i really enjoyed their salted chocolate chess and coconut custard pies! hm... my slice of chocolate chess is a lot smaller than the one i had last time... maybe it was because it was from a new pie?  do not think the store is closed if it's empty inside. if the door opens, just go in and someone will be there shortly. (or you can call just in case, which i did)  take your time looking at the pies and other baked goods. some of them are under glass/pie displays or on a rack.	1
who are these people giving this place anything more than 2 stars?!?? this place is disgusting! ugh! the only edible thing here is the fried bread. the food is terrible, and what is that thing they call hash brown? it's mushy potato with super fried outer crusts.  i ordered the french dip, and it was foul. the meat was rotten! it smelled funny, but i gave it the benefit of the doubt and took a bite. yuck! the waiter got so upset, and he insisted the meat was perfectly fine. yet, he held his head far away and refused to take a whiff of the rotten meat. needless to say i hurried home so i can be near a clean bathroom when shit breaks lose. no pun intended.  also, i hope all the people waiting in the long line outside know that they're falling prey to the restaurant's clever marketing plan. when the business was slow, riordan split the original pantry into two restaurants with a shared kitchen. the line would attract more people to the pantry, and he can use the extra space next door to open another restaurant. just some food for thought.	0
we eat at rg several times a year and always enjoy the food. on this night during restaurant week the four of us liked our entrees: pork ravioli, salmon, and bouillabaisse.  the rownut for dessert was decadent with a sweet and salty taste.  the cocktails were well prepared and generous.  the only negative would be the server.  on one hand she was very efficient and the food and drinks arrived promptly.  on the other hand she was very abrupt and just at the edge of rudeness.   if she made just the slightest effort to be less flip and a bit friendlier it would have made for a more enjoyable evening.	0
heard about whiz through beer belly, which is one of my favorite places, so i decided to try it out.  service was great, the cashier was very friendly and offered to answer any questions. me, being from the philly area and a cheesesteak connoisseur, needed nothing but some fries and a steak sandwich that i've been craving.   i ordered just a basic cheeseteak with american, no onions and an order of whiz fries. the steak looked great till i realized that the cheese was on the bottom and wasn't melted on the steak itself. the bread was perfect, (can't mess up an amoroso's roll) the steak itself had a nice flavor, but was way overcooked. usually when the cheese is melted on top of the meat, this can be covered up, but that was not the case here.   the fries on the other hand were great, nice and crisp. the homemade whiz sauce was delicious, but a bit thin. all the sauce was at the bottom of the container and i had to take the fries out and spoon it back on top.   overall, the cheesesteak was not impressive, boo's, philly west, and figueroa philly are all much better. i mean, no one in philly doesn't melt the cheese on top of the steak.  i'll be back for the fries though...with the cheese on the side.	0
the restaurant was not busy. the hostess took us in the back. we past plenty of open tables. our waitress took forever to greet us...we even waited for water. the food was good but lukewarm. we had to wave the waitress down for another cocktail. we were watching the other servers and they seemed to be on the ball. when we needed our waitress, we could see her through the mirrors chatting and laughing with the bartender...just inappropriate. we usually really like this restaurant but it was lacking overall this particular night.	1
i am a devotee of daniel boulud. i am a long-time devoted customer to daniel, cafe boulud, and less so, bistro moderne and bar boulud in nyc. so imagine my excitement at learning that  now that i've moved to boston last year, there would be a bar boulud here! yes!well, the globe in particular, and other reviewers expressed massive disappointment. so, my husband and i waited. and waited. and finally, we decided to go with three other couples for brunch last monday (president's day). a day where service would be slow (8+feet of snow!). in fact, service was quite good. the ambience is classic daniel, lovely, but with an injection of hip vibe.however, how can you mess up quiche lorraine? really? while others had better luck, two of us suffered through a parched mess. so much so that the crust was separated from the andquot;pieandquot; itself. truly unacceptable.  was it reheated? old? poorly crafted from the get-go? i don't think daniel is aware that boston is now the home of such intense professionals as barbara lynch! lydia shires! etc. should we give it another go? not sure it's worth the bother. or the price (which we don't mind paying, as long as there is a commensurate experience that goes along with it!!).	1
horrible place. this used to be a decent place up to about 6 months ago. they changed staff and the new people are completely incompetent. half the time i would place a phone order, and after 30 minutes they hadn't even send it to the kitchen. quality of food is mediocre. try to avoid!	0
amata is an excellent choice for semi-formal dining with a range of italians options. i ate here last week with my family and i was not disappointed! we had four different pastas, from tagliatelle to cavatelli and each was as good as the next. the service was great, all the staff were welcoming and knowledgeable and the food was really good. loved the food here, specially the seafood salad and calamari in sauce for appetizers. the wine i had was wonderful and desserts were excellent. overall, we had a great time. would go back again with my loved ones any time!	1
i love that their menu has both seasonal and anchoring plates. we called in for a dinner reservation, even though open table said they had none available. plus points!their drinks are phenomenal!!! i can see myself coming back for drinks in the future. back to focus, we came for dinner. i ordered the chilean sea bass in ham hock and was able to try the flat iron. i recommend the flat iron! it was moist and delicious. the sea bass was fresh and light, but i felt like the fish's great flavors were a little washed out with the ham hock. it was a good plate, regardless. service was slow. our waitress had a great personality and her energy was invigorating!yes, the rooftop view is breath-taking.	1
fun menu with excellent flavor and friendly wait staff! highly recommended!	1
very tasty addition to the area. been here twice, ordered the brisket platter, excellent. we ordered to go and went next door for a drink, our food was delivered at the bar and we enjoyed it with a drink, perfect no fuss about eating food from another business at the bar and it was delicious with an ipa.	1
the food = fantastic  my boyfriend and i got the groupon which included 1 appetizer, 2 soups, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 deserts and a bottle of wine - it was fantastic!  we stared off with these chicken strips that had a nice handful of fries underneath and a tasty sweet and sour-like sauce on the side. the. we went on to the soup of the day which was a mushroom soup (it was declines and so velvety). the salads, were standard, a caesar salad and some fruit style type of salad which i did not enjoy ..  for wine, they allot you $45 and can choose any bottle of wine, if you go over then you just pay the difference.  for entrees, my boyfriend got the piano lomo saltado that came with strips of beef, fries and white rice = so juicy and stirring it all together pays out for heaven. i got this mahi mahi dish that came with mussels on top of mashed potatoes and veggies on the side.. those mussels were literally the best tasting mussels i've ever had. wow.  for dessert we didn't get to choose but they brought us out this caramelo chocolate dish and it reminded me of ice cream sandwiches.. and honestly, who doesn't like those :)  i do believe that having an extra helper on the floor would help the flow of the restaurant better. we didn't get our bottle of wine until our third course just cuz thy were so busy and only had two people taking orders for the whole place. parking is also a bit of a situation but other than that the food is delicious and i highly recommend it for a date night	1
okay, so it used to be a fast food restaurant, and it still has a drive thru. actually kind of nice if you order takeout you don't even have to get out of your car. but we were eating in tonight. decor is minimal but clean. ordered pad kee mao and spicy basil with chicken. both at a heat level 2. i like spicy but since we haven't been here before we decided to play it safe. so glad we did. most places this heat level would be a 4. any spicier and it would have been too hot. but both dishes were delicious. fresh veggies, white meat chicken and freshly cooked with the veggies still crisp tender. very good. service was very good but we were the only ones dining in so i wouldn't expect less. our water glasses stayed full. we will definitely be back.	1
horrible, snotty service. overpriced mexican at its worst.	0
my husband and i dined with friends on valentine's night here. what an evening to remember! we visit the kitchen in boulder often, but this was our first time at the chicago location.   as we were lead to our table, the chic interior set the tone for the experience we were about to have. beautiful views of the city and river brought the outdoors in, and complimented the on point decor inside.   we were greeted with champagne to begin the evening. it was the best i have ever experienced. the sommelier was generous with his time in explaining the background of what we were drinking. we chose to have our dinners accompanied with the wine pairings. evening on a busy night like valentine's, each glass was served with expert knowledge.  my husband and i are vegetarians. the kitchen always treats our dietary restrictions with great ease. we had the wild mushroom and french black truffle tagliatelle. wooooooow! it was divine! as was our dessert.   the thing that makes the kitchen so special is the superb service. no detail left unnoticed. its the little things like folding my napkin when i excused myself from the table, coursing each plate perfectly and everyone smiles!   thank you kitchen for making our special evening all the more memorable. we cannot wait to join you again!	1
we love coming here for their baked pork chop and spicy salt. we also usually get one of the fried rice dishes with our meal. the only knock on the place is the location. never had a bad experience and we always look forward to coming here to eat.	1
lived in a building right next door, so formerly frequented this establishment... saturday we moved out of the neighborhood, so went for a goodbye brunch.   the table across from us complained about plastic in their veggie burger - gross. but not gross enough for us to leave. i ordered the caesar salad and my boyfriend got the kale caesar. everything was fine until... i found a bird feather in my salad. like, mixed in, with dressing on it. gross gross gross.   our server was nowhere to be found, so we told the hostess, who took the feather inside. when the sever finally came out, he was like, and so i heard about the feather - can i get you a cookie or something?and  - are you serious? no thank you.   it seemed like the server thought the whole situation was hilarious, and i should feel lucky that they removed the salad from my bill. gee thanks.   this place is disgusting, will never come back.	0
omg..the food was soooo good. i ordered online on new year's day. my husband went to pick up the food and everything was ready for pick up minus the dessert i ordered. they ran out of tres leches so for the inconvenience they gave me a free dessert..very thoughtful. the food was cooked to perfection..in all honesty..way better than sergios around the corner. so glad they opened down the street..we will be ordering from them again soon!!!	1
we went to bluegrass after moving in a couple blocks away. great place. neighborhood feel, friendly servers, and a great menu. definitely worth checking out. no complaints from me or my fiance. we'll definitely be back.	0
never got to eat here because the flakey hostess was going to sit my 3 person party at a very small 2 seater table that was already connected to another couple crouching to eat their food. she was like and  it really is meant for 3 people..and  really? really? if there isn't room for 3 dinner plates it's not a 3 seater. whatever, turned around and walked to another restaurant.	0
best banana cream pie ever!!!	1
came here a few weeks ago and enjoyed a delightful dinner. we ordered a plain cheese pizza, which to me is the test if a pizza joint is either good or bad. if you can't make a good cheese pizza, then i don't want to try anything else.  although it wasn't the best pizza i've ever had it was quite yummy. perhaps if the crust wasn't infused with herbs i would've liked it more. i believe it had specks of oregano which i'm not that crazy about. sans the oregano the pizza would've been close to perfect.  the staff was nice and the atmosphere was very chill. the entire restaurant is covered in unique art work and quotes painted by the employees and owners i assume. the misfit poster sealed the deal for me.  i will definitely come back and try their other items!	1
cute atmosphere, plenty of outlets, good wifi, friendly staff, awesome coffee. nothing bad to write!	1
went here with a large group over the past weekend. the owner of the restaurant was very nice and very helpful with our group!  we ordered everything on the menu, but some things that stood out to me..  bone marrow was delicious! it reminded me of purple pigs. the mussels were also very good! the homemade beef jerky was awesome, and i finally got to taste non-gas station beef jerky!  their desserts were also amazing! we ordered all 3 on the menu, and they were all sooooo good! so make sure you save room for desserts! they had some banana bread pudding dessert that they are serving during restaurant week that you have to get!	1
five stars for the ambiance and deserts (which are made by a local woman!). very comfortable atmosphere: cozy, welcoming, friendly. if you are looking for to get away from the party crowds, and have a drink in a dimly lit, interestingly decorated bar with good service- this is the spot.	0
freshest sashimi artfully presented is near 5*(but the smallest micro cuts) when served by the talented and caring eric, but sadly the wait for food service here is ridiculously long as the charming eric tries to personally accommodate everyone, and i mean everyone (mission impossible). the waitresses are sweet though mediocre and persistently to pushy with refills (i still have a half of beer left and she wants me to order another??)... if your not careful you will have easily polished off 3 beers before you even get your first order. typically we wait at least 30 minutes after sit down until first food order arrivals... tastes great, but not fun and no way worth the long waits for food (usually 2 and half hours for a few orders and a lot of beer and saki) and then there's the big, almost tokyo priced, ticket at the end. we have visited this yummy grill only 10 times hoping service would improve, but unfortunately not to be. i trust your experience here will be perfect if it's only eric and you )with no other patrons to share him with), otherwise this long time native l.a. sushi addict highly recommends you journey to the fabulous sen sushi for the complete package of joy and sushi happiness.	0
brand new location in brickell! they serve both vietnamese and chinese cuisine. yessss!!!!  very reasonably priced and they have lunch specials. i tried the americanized chinese dish and shrimp egg foo youngand . it was excellent. i brought it home and devoured it. i definitely am interested to see how their vietnamese fare matches up to other vietnamese restaurants i've tried.   the location is small and cute and very clean. they opened a week ago so give them a try!	1
i have been to the vineyard many times.  the food, service and wines are outstanding!	0
the service was excellent, the food was 4 star good, and the beer list is eclectic and fun.	1
i enjoy coming here even though it is a little out of the way. i can usually find parking in the residential area, about a block away. i give it four stars because i have not tried most of the foods or any of the desserts here. however, i also give toast four stars because i find their wraps and mushroom barley soup rather tasty. their side fruits are better than your average fruit bowl as well. they add berries and a few other fruits to their melons. i'm a sucker for blackberries. i like to bring friends here when they want to try something slightly upscale but not way out of their price range.	1
i still cannot believe i paid $42 before tip for the most tiny piece of and roll' ever!! i literally laughed when they handed me my order of the noah's ark (sample of 2 half rolls of each). first of all, my issue here with luke's does not simply rely on the hidden location and service which ill get into soon but the fact that they have the audacity to have the word rolls on their menu just baffles me! with the cost you are charging, you can at least save us the agony of serving cheap hot dog buns and ripping them in half with the nerve to call them 'half rolls' then charging so much for them. i get that the cost of seafood can be high but the lobster which is the most important part was not even that great. ive had better. the seasoning was good which is what saved me from going back to the counter and demanding a refund lol.....  either way its safe to say i wont be returning and its a shame since i spend so much time over in bk bridge park. but the main reason is because there is a young guy there with glasses who had the nerve to shoo me away while he was texting on his phone one time because i knocked on the window to ask the operating hours, which apparently i had missed that day. im like dude its fine if your closed i dont bite, i just want to know what your hours are... rude! (its 11a-4p btw) ...then he opens the door and claims he didnt hear me because hes sick- like that makes any sense.  anyway, not worth your time or money. maybe in the summer if they ever decide to change their fake hot dog buns into real rolls and serve even a slightly larger portion ill reconsider.	0
vegetarian sandwich is really good!! no cheese and mayo to make it vegan :) guys here are so nice. i usually have to ask for water but they offered us water. will definitely be back!!	1
one my favorite breakfast places but also serve lunch and dinner. just enjoyed the brisket red potato hash w/ avocado poached egg. great flavor and protein to start your day!	1
totally love la cafe' they have the best french fries in dtla.it can get a little busy there on weekends around 2am so a good tip is to call your order in for pickup.	1
i just went on eat 24 to try to order pizza from these and highway robbersand  and the delivery charge alone was 6 dollars!!!!! wtf!!!!!! the normal fee anywhere is from $1.50 to $3 dollars!!!!! thats an incredible rip off!!!! thats double than usual!!!!!! i will never order delivery from these thieves!!!!!!	0
this is the first and the last time i will be going here! i ordered a burger with my boyfriend and the first bite was into literally raw meat. the outside of the burger was brown but the inside was lukewarm and (not kidding) pink! my boyfriend's burger was the same but he ate his anyway...i was disgusted and asked them to re-cook mine. also, the arnold palmer drink was more like lemon and water; they make enough money off of this shake shack gimmick you'd think they can afford to add some iced tea and sugar. personally i like and five guy'sand  burgers much better, this was e coli on a bun with some dirty lemon water to wash it down. .	0
the six is a great place to drunk brunch. $10 bottomless mimosas = a steal! i've been here a few times (once for dinner and once for brunch). overall, very cute place. service is good. prices are reasonable for what it is. my previous trip i had a six burger and this time around i had the egg sandwich. both were good if very plain. my friend had the italian egg something or other and it was delicious (though a bit salty from all that pancetta). my only beef is that both times i felt like i could probably achieve the same results at home. would really like to see them take there food up a gourmet notch or two. they definitely have potential.	1
2 stars because food was just okay. the famous chicken pot pie was bland. the desserts were very good..pecan pie and carrot cake were amazing. staff was extremely pleasant. atmosphere is warm and cozy and roomy.	0
warm, dark, and cozy - my kind of place. the place already had a wait at 6:30pm on a friday. we waited about 15 minutes for a spot which was thankfully not right by the door (being in the basement, cold air sinks down the stairs, despite the two doors between the restaurant and outside).	0
alas, i have but one regret in going here: i didn't get the pig's head. so what a great reason to go back again. actually, i already have plenty of reasons to go back again. let's start with the black pepper rigatoni with the boar ragu. or the black ink pasta. or their focaccia. or the... ok, you get the point.  want a meal for yourself? you can go that route. want to share plates? you can go that direction, too. we did the latter, and every dish was a hit. so was the wine, and charlatan has a solid list of vino. i was jealous of the couple that got the pig head two tables down because it looked and smelled fantastic. ah well, if at first you don't eat pig head, try to go back again :)	1
i love these smaller ny and sf-style restaurants that keep popping up. the six has solid food and a quaint, rustic atmosphere. tvs hang in the corners, which is a little odd since it's more a restaurant than a bar, but they were showing old movies, which was kind of cool. i made reservations for 4 people on a saturday night, but actually didn't need to. food-wise the only thing i didn't like was the cassoulet. i love cassoulet so i'm on the pickier side, but this was basically a skillet of beans. skip it. the mussels, however, were delightful as was the parmesan cheese covered corn on the cob. the server even took it back to have it cut into 4 pieces. the tomato and burrata salad was fresh and light and creamy- definitely a highlight. and it was a nice-sized portion as well! i'd like to go back and try the burger, as well as a few other things on the menu next time.	1
excellent brunch, with a drink option. try the bloody mary! lots of beer options, including those from next door at the essen haus.	0
finally got to umami burger after countless people telling me to go. well, i did it...and i was pleased. love it when a restaurant automatically cooks their burgers medium rare. and i appreciate their attitude about the quality of their food. our server was great. gave us the whole umami introduction and even went to find out the consensus on the pronunciation of my new favorite beer: xingu. i was pleased they carried it and also my current favorite cider, julian. we got the cali burger. i like to start out with a relatively simple version as a basic test. having passed that easily, i will move on to their umami burger with caramelized onions and shiitake mushrooms next time. and i will not be sharing again. these burgers are on the small side and i want ever bite i can get.	1
excellent food, great atmosphere and view. the service was quick and professional, nothing to complain about there. we had the baked brie appetizer, i had the pot-au-feu short ribs and my fiance the chicken supreme, and shared the orange cardamom creme brulee. all were excellent, although there was maybe a slightly heavy hand with the cardamom (i like the flavor, but it drowned out the orange and vanilla a bit). the only misstep was syncing up the drink and food service; i was halfway through my entree before i was offered a new drink (after finishing my cocktail), and the after-dinner drink arrived long after dessert. also, the spicy jalepeno cocktail is really spicy. that's not necessarily a bad thing, but i was expecting a little hum of jalepeno and got a blast of heat (and i'm generally a fan of spicy food). regardless, very well done overall and we'd definitely go back.regarding the reviews about people having bad service with groups, this is not a big space, there are very few big tables, i'm honestly surprised they even allow reservations for more than 6 or so. i would not recommend this as a place for large groups, but for an intimate, 2 or 4 person meal, it's excellent.	1
went here to get dessert after dinner with a few friends. ordered a brownie and it had no listing about having nuts in the brownie after eating it and having an allergic reaction without realizing... i said to the waiter who said and well all brownies have nuts in themand  walked away. then when approaching the manager about this he said it was my fault for not asking about the nuts and said they have nuts in all the desserts. also my friends had apple pie and it was dreadful. the food really blew. don't go here ever. terrible management.	0
haven't eaten yet, but.... i think this is gonna be good....this is a long overdue update....the place is great. no bells and whistles.they do have a fairly creative lot of pizza though. it's all around damn good pizza. 'nough said.	1
wow. two previous restaurants have failed in this spot - third time is most definitely the charm.   came here for a birthday dinner and it was perfect in every way - great ambiance and service adding to the whole experience, but it was the phenomenal flavors that gets cow and clover 5 stars. the octopus starter was scrumptious. wanted to lick the plate. the endive and farro salad was delicious. the burger - mouth-watering. the special of the day - a boneless pork shoulder - totally epic. all paired with (several bottles) of totally reasonably priced ($40) really, really good wine.   can't wait to be back.	1
had been wanting to try this place for a while. finally made it in. observed everyone else's food which looked amazing. their menu was plentiful. i ordered a grilled a grilled cheese and my bf ordered a breakfast sandwich. both were awful. there was nothing grilled about my cheese, it was cold and unmelted and there wasn't a server in sight to request another. the coffee was good. my advice save your money go somewhere else.	0
i have had every kale salad in williamsburg, and this is the best. the only negatives are that it's not open on sundays, and the rest of the menu is slightly inconsistent - sometimes the sandwiches are fantastic, and sometimes they just taste off.	1
i used to like the grove but it has become increasing disappointing over the years. it's just ok now. the food always leaves something to be desired. to top it off, last time i was in there they passed by my table and asked if i wanted a refill of tea. i say sure, and they drop it off with a check for $2. not cool.	0
we eat out often and crave didn't meet our expectations. while the service was outstanding, the food/drinks are just so-so. with many restaurant choices in around the dt summerlin area, there are no plans to visit crave anytime soon.	0
tried it all. haven't been disappointed yet. asada fries are delicious!	1
i actually came here awhile back soon after the place had first opened after discovering it on yelp. i thought cheese, sandwiches, and salads, how could i not fall in love.   i am not going to lie when you walk in everything is positively overwhelming. it's a bistro and a cheese store mixed with books and little nick knacks.   after getting some help from the staff, we ordered the spanish field greens along with the italian caprese at the counter and eagerly waited for its arrival.   and waited. yea still waiting. granted the place was busy, there system for delivering the food to customers is a disaster. there is a small window on the right where they call your name from to your food, but this window is surrounded by cheese and tables so you can't stand there because you will be in the way. so then after you finish admiring all the cheese and have three rounds of the samples you are left awkwardly waiting for your food, but some do people go ahead and sit down. if nobody responds to the name called the food runner has the task of finding which table or person standing ordered the ordered food by their last name. yea as i said, not a good process. so after 25 minutes of my friend and i taking turns on awkwardly waiting, the food was ready.   the reason why i ordered the spanish field greens was because it had manchego on it, but it was sliced so thin that i couldn't even taste it. the dressing was bland and tasteless and i really did feel like a rabbit solely eating lettuce. i had ordered the sandwich to be pressed and warm upon recommendation by the staff member, and it came out cold and blah. the mozzarella was fresh, but the basil wasn't and the balsamic left the sandwich a bit soggy.   overall i had a pretty awful experience there and the place has gotten so many good reviews that i want to go again to hopefully alter my views, but for now the damage has been done.	0
first thing's first, i dislike paying for expensive asian food, especially since i know i can probably get something tastier for cheaper down the street. that being said, nan king is alright but i feel that it's a bit pricey for what you get. the only time i eat here is when my non-asian friends want chinese food that's not too scary. 'nuff said.	0
delicious paninis and salads. the flavors are vibrant and you feel like you're in italy!	1
amazing happy hour!!!	1
(3 months ago)korean fried chicken crawl. stop #2: dined there right after the blah experience at bon chon!spicy: too spicy for my taste buds garlic soy: oh soy garlicy good!crispy tenders: yummy! crispy and juicy!cons: pricey, but i'd still go back once in a long while!long wait time.the verdict...so far:#1 my bff's delicious homemade korean fried chicken wing#2 kyochon#3: hite#4: chicken day#5: bon chon	1
stopped by on a tuesday evening and this place was empty. hill and dale has only been opned for 2 months. a lot of seats, my friends and i sat by the door where the was a couch  we ordered:  sliders (with pork belly) - i liked the beef sliders with pork belly much more than just the regular beef sliders  double fried fries - so addicting, we ordered 4 of these  each of the oysters - i'm not an oyster fan, but my friends scarfed down 4 plates of oysters  second time around i stopped by just for the hazelnut macaron ice cream with blueberry peach compote and van leeuwen ice cream, and unfortunately i was a little disappointed as this was just okay!	1
looovvee this place! everything are just excellent! from the service, food, ambiance. i really enjoy coming here, always hit the spot. except for the drive. i really hope they open one around pasadena area, i'm sure that'll be a big hit!	1
meh, i've had better. certainly overpriced, have to say that the salsa may be good but it's not making $15 burrito and drink lunch worth it. burritos shouldn't try to claim gourmet. keep it fresh, simple and reasonably priced thanks!	0
the one drink i got here was mostly taken up by a giant ice cube so it didn't get me drunk. seemed pretty cool, maybe too cool for me and my okcupid first date. enjoy!	1
so i'm on here for business. i'm from l.a. and i really haven't had cuban food before but sweet baby je-sus this food was off the chain! i mean from the bread to the mojito to the chicken...yes, yes, yes!   i had the chicken fricassee (fricase de pollo) with sweet potatoes, black beans and rice, and fried plantains. mmm. it's been a loooong time since i had some fried plantains i tell you! the chicken was so moist and tender, it just came off the bone. mmm! and the potatoes were tender. the plantains were fried perfectly. the black beans and rice were a bit dry but they usually are. my mojito was the best mojito i've ever had. i don't know what rum my waiter put in it but i only drank 1/4 of it and i was buzzin' hard! lol. luckily my hotel is 2 lights away! lol! the bread was like a garlic, olive oil, lime concoction maybe...on fresh, soft, sourdough bread.  mmmm perfecto!  i haven't had a meal like that in i dunno how long.  i'm a picky eater and very critical but this place...5 stars hands down! you have to go there!   ;)  es excellente!	1
very good place to eat in la. it's fame has true reason. i came here with some friend's after attending the annual johnny ramone tribute at hollywood forever and had never been here before. well, the spots it had on the travel channel were very correct when they praised it. i had their famous pastrami/corned beef and it was unbelievably good. plain and simple.  even the pickles you get on the side somehow stand out amongst the world of relatively normal pickled cucumber spears. kosher truly has a new place in my heart(no, that was not a clogged artery joke, but i digress). i ended my visit by stopping at their wall of baked goods, purchasing a slice of their cheesecake while i was at it to take home with me. the next day when i had it, i found nirvana. and it wasn't the washington based grungy kind either, but the rich and creamy kind dipped in udder glory.  ok, now to be human for a change. the only things to not enjoy about the place is:  1.) the noise level. it's a bit noisy, but maybe only if you were me and were sitting next to an unknown music producer who had a flock of desperate woman with him, laughing at every little joke he would make, regardless of it truly being funny or even without a single hint of successful timing to them as if they were ray liotta in and goodfellasand  kissing joe pesci's ass via his trademark hyena cackle.  2.) the price. but you gotta spend money to get what's worth the money, so deal with it and you'll be in jewish heaven. if that's a thing...	1
awesome mussels! good food! should try this place out.	1
get ready to wait in line for about an hour for ridiculous food you can probably make at home. these long wait times happen especially on weekends, weeknights, and sometimes even lunch.  highly priced food, might i add. i used to not mind going when they still had the chicken vino bianco, which was chicken in white wine sauce with onions, garlic and oil over a bed of pasta. now that they removed that item, i don't go very often. one of the last times i went i found a piece of soft plastic wrapping surrounding my chicken on the plate of food. it was about 3-4 inches long and disgusting. the waiter discounted my food and apologized, so thats good, i guess. the other day i went for lunch and decided to try the pizza. what a mess. it was mostly crust, with the toppings barely there. some of it was burned black. just a disaster.  if there's two things keeping me from giving it zero stars, its the bread and salad, and the service. next time i might just eat some bread, salad and soup. that seems to be the way to go.	0
it's been a few years since we've been back in the area.  i was very happy to see that bistro blanc is still an excellent restaurant with great service.  the five of us really enjoyed our meals and the recommended wine.	0
let me break the scene down for you: unemployed girls on their phones browsing instagram, gallons of perfume wearing persians looking for "that hot chick over there, bro" and food that will make you say "you know, that big mac sounds really good right now." garbage scene of clowns with food to match. went here once when it opened, ran out an hour later and never came back, bro.	0
came here to kill some time during our one hour wait at sushi hama. but it was so lovely that after dinner, we came back for more drinks! make sure you sit outside when you come at night, because they have really pretty lights and i think they play movies sometimes. all day happy hour on sunday! the chardonnay house wine was no bueno, tasted very watered down. but def. get the beer! don't recall which beers we ordered but all three were very good!	1
worst service ever defines what i think about this place. i can't even write about the pizza since the service really killed it for me... and i only called to ask for a delivery... the person was so rude i thought about calling and canceling my order. i don't think i'll ever recommend this place...	0
for the past decade i have found the food at gertrudes to be consistently bad-to-mediocre, no matter who the head chef is. i am always amazed that the vegetables look and taste like they've simply been run under hot water and that no one thinks to add some salt or pepper or (gasp) a delicious sauce to make them even slightly above average. to put it bluntly, the food is bland...as though the restaurant caters slowly to the museum's elderly patrons. i go to gertrude's a couple of times a year during the spring and summer for one reason only: ambience. the restaurant itself is warm, bright and lovely, with live jazz during brunch, and the outdoor seating by the fountain is unbeatable. lastly, there is nothing quite like strolling around the museum's sculpture garden on a beautiful summer's day after a filling (if not fulfilling) meal. if your priority is exceptional food, go someplace else, but if you simply want to be in lovely surroundings, are entertaining elderly people with spice or dietary restrictions, or want to impress non-foodie visitors or business partners with one of the loveliest places to eat in baltimore, go to gertrudes.	0
toulouse petite was amazing. the fried oyster po boy was a delight and the crawfish beignets were to die for. this is a definite must try restaurant	1
i really wanted to like this place. it had all the ingredients of a place i would love to come often. my husband and i ordered the pork belly steamed buns for appetizer, and then ordered a ramen bowl each. the steamed buns were good, but the ramen were so disappointing. i ordered the spicy miso ramen, and it had so much ginger in it that all i could taste in the broth was ginger. i like ginger, but it's supposed to be added and gingerlyand  to enhance the flavors of other ingredients in the food, not overpower them all. the price was also high for what was given. i wouldn't have minded paying $9-12 for tiny tiny steamed buns and $12-16 for a bowl of ramen, because this place is so convenient for us. if only it had better food! i'm surprised that other people like this place so much. maybe i should give them one more chance...	0
really good pizza and cool decor . i had the hawaiian pizza and it was one of the best i've had. my boyfriend had the slaughterhouse pizza and he couldn't stop taking about how amazing it was. will definitely be back!!	1
i have been to range twice now. first for the gluten free pancake and today for the cilantro potatoes ( also gf...like eggs benedict with potatoes in place of the english muffin--genius!). i love how charming and beautiful the atmosphere is here. you can relax and stay a while....seems like that's what they invite you to do with their cozy chair areas. service is also great. glad this gem is in my neighborhood!	1
service was wonderful and the happy hour menu is well worth it - plus a diverse selection of beers on tap. i recommend it!	1
unmemorable. salty broth. poser when compared to santouka. can't touch that.  only good thing is the soft boiled egg. carry on folks.	0
totally cool place tucked away in the downtown arts district. it's a great place to go that's not your typical hollywood/downtown la/beverly hills experience. love that it's so far separated from all that nonsense.planchette de charcuterie - got the petit size and it was the perfect portions. all the pates were delish. there wasn't a single one i didn't enjoy or felt was too gamey.bouillabaisse - got the entree size and it was very rich and cozy. perfect for a cold, windy la evening. the broth was a little spicy, which i'm not too big of a fan of. the seafood is very fresh. mussels were sweet and refreshing. the prawns are huge! make sure to drench the head in the broth and drink all the juices.sauteed brussel sprouts - not normally a fan of brussel sprouts, but they sauteed theirs nicely with bacon, shallots, and butter. it's a little heavy but still delicious if you control yourself.overall, a fantastic place. i would definitely come again to try more items on their menu. this is also a great place to take a date because of the intimate setting, yet it's not too pretentious but very classy.	1
tourist trap. nothing special. seems like too much effort for below average diner food. it feels more like a feeding troth than a place and start your day. almost any diner on the east coast and definitely norm's puts this place to shame.inexpensive, low quality ingredients make for low quality food. if you are on a tight budget, and need the most calories for your dollar i'd go. if you want good food go to norm's or bottega louis.	0
the manager was especially thoughtful and made a point to read my note in the reservation that it was our belated valentine's day and we had enjoyed roy's on several occasions while in hawaii. they were so kind as to leave a card and some ribbons on our table and offered us their delicious poke appetizer. our server was also fantastic. it was a great night out, and we need it since we have a 00 month old!	0
not a great experience. meal was very mediocre for the price. not high quality like other steak houses in vegas. decor is nice and works pleasant. mistake was made on our bill. we were not given the discount for our total rewards card.  even after it was corrected, still not right. shady to me. better steak houses around there.	0
i had a great maiden voyage with canter's. i went to langer's a couple years ago when i heard about the great jewish deli tradition in la and was pleased, so i decided to make it a point to try the equally important historical delis in the area.  the decor and vibe is as cool as it gets. old school ny deli vibe, but with a diner flare that only the west coast can provide (since we have more physical space). it's important to note that this old school vibe is not tacky, nor is it like walking into a dusty mausoleum. the place is not old, rather, it is classic, meaning they have faithfully preserved the fundamental character of the place, while still maintaining a modern restaurant.  food: the pickles are spot on. crisp with just the right amount of spice. i had the brooklyn ave. w/ corned beef and potato salad, while my guest had a pastrami reuben w/ fries. my sandwich hit all the right notes---corned beef, slaw, russian dressing, jewish rye. i had a couple bites of the reuben and was equally as pleased. the potato salad has an interesting sweet side to it that contrasts really well with the smoke of the meat and bite of the dressing and pickles.   the only thing i am sad about, is not being able to take advantage of the bakery. there are some amazing looking things in that cabinet.	1
perch you are an awesome venue a little bit hard to find but if you get confused from taking the elevators just follow the little bird and it will take you up to perch. the amazing views of the downtown city is amazing. i would say it is really worth it.   when i went here it was at night around 8:00 p.m, i found street parking and walked to the building on hill street. it doesn't look like much but once you get on top it looks a whole lot cooler.   for dinner i try to have light dinners if i go out and eat at a nice place and i wanted to get a salad. they didn't have that many options but each salad sounded soo amazing that it was really hard to choose which one i really really wanted to grub on.   i ordered the baby mixed green salad which was $11.00. the salad price wasn't at all bad the the portion was just right for me. i can see it being a little bit small for others so be careful if you are starving then i would not recommend just eating a salad. the baby mixed green salad came with pears, candied walnuts, red onions, maytag blue and balsamic vinaigrette. if you don't really like a lot of dressing on your salads i would let your server know to put it on the side for an even more healthier option.   the service was very quick once we ordered our food didn't take that long to get onto our table. i enjoyed the salad i had and my friend enjoyed the chicken. we both ate our plates clean and enjoyed the nice city lights.   highly recommend getting a reservation and also taking your girl out for a nice dinner :)	1
great food, and a great restaurant experience in general. they just don't make places like this anymore...i had a hickory burger and my friend had a steakburger, both with fries, and both were delicious, if a little messy. then again, i don't go to a burger joint for impeccable presentation. loved the ambiance, it's like you can feel the history of the place just sitting at the counter. will definitely be back to try the pie!	1
i want to call this a hole in the wall, but inside this bar seems huge. there's an outdoor patio area with stringed lights, and an indoor area with snes games and jean-claude van damme movies on projector screens. they have a huge list of draught beers, which made my beer-loving self happy. then disappointed that i drank so many dumb pbrs at dodger stadium so i couldn't partake at far bar.but i did get a far bar burger! the gouda on the burger totally makes it. normal, thin french fries on the side. my friend and i totally coveted the karaage chicken once the smell hit our noses, so that might be on order next time.the atmosphere is really nice here. it seems super laid back, but full of beautiful people. i felt kind of slobby in my post-baseball game attire, so you might want to switch out the sneakers for extra-clean sneakers when you visit.	1
husband had the etouffe and liked it the fried gator was good. nice snack but pricey.	1
the best spot for a weekend brunch i like everything on the menu, super fresh and delicious. great customer service	1
grood (great/good) chowder and perfect on a cold wet day!	0
probably one of my favorite spots in dtla, and a staple for taking friends from out of town. classy but relaxed rooftop lounge with food (get the pork belly, truffle poutine, and squash gnocchi) and cocktails that are on point. if you dislike crowds, go during a weekday or make a reservation and skip the complaints. perch is one of those well-rounded spots that's great for dates or going out with friends...or one of those nights where you feel like pretending you're at a nyc rooftop bar in summer.	1
thai place is adorable. my friends and i come here for brunch and have never had an issue getting a table. the food is great and if you like chilaquiles, it's amazing here!! they do bottomless mimosas and seriously never let you see the bottom of your glass...so watch out.	1
fantastic place, great decor and great food/drinks. very different from what ive seen anywhere else, puts you in that perfect mood to eat, drink and just hang. try the sonju yogurt alcoholic drink, you'll thank me for that one, killer! well done guys!!	1
way expensive for the quality of food. maybe for the old days of the food truck, but not for a sit down	0
dive bar and proud of it. this isn't my scene, but low key and cheap for a few drinks on a weeknight. $10 pitchers of beer. good service. sit at the bar or grab a table.	0
*cost effective lunch - 5 stars	0
dropped in on a lazy saturday afternoon (valentine's day) without any expectations... beautifully redone old home... super welcoming staff... and it turned out there was a free porto tasting the afternoon! we settled at a table, ordered one of the most delicious and light butter lettuce salads (bh salad) we have ever had. we were free to flit back and forth between the table and tasting - the server was very knowledgable about the porto being served and enjoyed learning more about the drink and interacting with folks who came in. things really picked up at happy hour (3-6pm daily) with festive spanish music picking up the cheer throughout. we ordered a grenache/syrah red on recommendation and enjoyed thoroughly a cheese monger plate with 3 cheeses. staff very friendly and even helped us store our chicken apple sausage in their fridge (just came from market, not expecting to stop for so long)... all in all a perfect blend of neighborhood charm and opportunity to try a fine selection of drink and food. highly recommend when you're in the madrona area!	1
yum!	1
trust me, this place may not offer the glamour from the interior, it may lack some curb appeal but i consider it a hollywood historical diner. i get good vibes from this place and it has left a mark in my late night dinings. in addition to great service, great memories i've shared with friends and delicious classic jewish cuisine, the pastries are a must have to take home. it is located in fairfax just a few blocks from ethiopian town.. definitely attracts diverse crowd. and, i have seen adrien garner here. and no i won't pick up the name i just dropped. ;-)	1
possibly the best burger i've ever had in life -- juicy but not greasy. fries perfect crust perfect salt. dare i say it? better than red mill.	1
today was my first at perch. i loved it!i had the french toast and it was super delicious and filling. i extremely recommend it, you could not go wrong with this dish.not only do i really like there food but the atmosphere is awesome. they have live music that is very beautiful for brunch! i will definitely be retuning!!	1
yum! so this place other than having a great name is a bit hard to park at, but its right next to a metro train stop and has decent freeway access. the joint seems fairly popular with those that wanna get some takeout or have found parking somewhere in the adjacent area.i came in super hungry and ended up getting a single slice. i was stoked that they sold pie by the slice, as often times, when i am alone, i cant eat a whole pie. unless i want to feel like a bloated sow. pro tip: there is a mini super hard to see out of parking lot on the east side of this place, but backing out into traffic is a bit daunting...so i got a slice of pepperoni. i was extremely pleased to start digging into it with the herbs mixed into the thin crust. it was pretty tasty. the cheese was the right amount of this slice as well. the bad thing is that there were not that many pepperoni's on it =\ i would definitely have wanted a few more per slice if i had gotten a whole pie.they have a lot of specialty pizzas here so pay attention to the board up above to see what all is available for your consumption here in purgatory. definitely its a place to visit and enjoy more than once. yum!	1
visited the roof for a lunch meeting this week and came away with a positive impression of the place, largely down to the excellent view and service. the latter can range from overbearing and disruptive to non-existent at the other end of the scale but the balance was just right at the roof.  food-wise the selection is adequate for lunch. fairly typical fare for this this type of mid-range restaurant. if you're willing to pay much more for a fancier experience then try the penninsula rooftop. my burger was ok. nothing too memorable. in fact slightly disappointing with the lackluster cheese bread and lukewarm fries - hence 4 stars not 5. serve inandout burgers here and you'd get 5!  if it's a clear warm day (ie. 90% of days in la!) and you're in the area then come here and you'll be happy you did.	1
overall a wonderful dining experience... the restaurant itself provides a cute and quiet space.  the food and service was also excellent.  our desert was slightly delayed (we barely even noticed) and our waiter was incredibly apologetic.  when we went to pay, he had taken the wine off of our bill... a nice surprise!  i will definitely go back again soon.	0
a group of 5 celebrated a milestone birthday.  i ordered a cake in advance from the rio bakery.  the manger picked it up and had it delivered to the table wen we finished our meal.  afterwards, our server stored the leftover cake in theirr wine cooler, so we could pick it up afte a show we attended.  i appreciated their exceptional service.	1
i've only been to the rooftop bar, which provides a super awesome view of pershing square and downtown l.a. the crafted cocktails are great, a little pricey, but great. if you're a fan of ginger crafted cocktails try the penicillin.	1
absolutely stunning food. bold fresh flavors. must have appetizers are shrimp scampi, crab dip with homemade ritz crackers and nona's meatballs. i also loved the grilled barramundi and brussel sprouts. will definitely come back!	1
took about 15mins (if not longer) to get our tiny over priced drinks. busboys were very nice and a lot more attentive than our server. i expected more from this place, definitely wont come here again.	0
i stopped in last night solo to try out this new spot in my neighborhood. the crabby shack did not disappoint! it was cute and small, with not a ton of people inside but great music (old school hip hop while i was there). very chill vibe which is nice in comparison to a lot of the overly packed places on franklin.  i had the crab roll - so good! it was super full of crab meat that was well seasoned and the bun was tasty too! the crab flavored chips were a great side too, and next time i wanna try some of their other side orders!  one of the owners (i forget her name) came by to say hi - she was suuuuuper sweet and i was kinda geeked to see business owners in the hood that still have faces like mine :)  i'll definitely be a regular there now (my girlfriends have been dying to try it so now i can vouch for them!). only took off one star because i wish i could have had a beer with my crab roll :)	1
i wouldn't normally dine on park ave south, but work brought me here. also, i am a vegeterian, but go with the flow when with other people. that said, the warm staff immediately helped me get over the semi-formal vibe, and the rich, meaty courses i tried were outstanding. the osso bucco lasagna with house made pasta and a marrow-filled bone in the center was the mvp (most valuable plate). the eggplant and the mushroom small plates from the antipasti bar were also delicious. not groundbreaking, but so succulent that they are worth ordering. did not try the short ribs or lobster farro soup - but i have no doubt they are on par with the lasagna.	1
excellent cuban desserts solid croquettes, pastelitos, bocadillos (try the mini one with ham cheese and ground meat) lots of variety, including the merenguito, dulce de coco, capuchinos, etc.	1
this is a nice spot for late night diner. i tried abalone chowder, it's light and delicious. by the way, the little beef dish is the best! it's awesome.	1
i just had the most amazing bowl of noodles in my life!!! i ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was everything i ever expected and more. the presentation was amazing. a bowl full of flavor, colors, and texture. the restaurant was very nice, clean, and had great service. i would definitely drive four hours for another bowl.i've gone back a few times and still remains amazing!!	1
i go to the o.p. weekends for lunch. except they take cash only everything is nice in this restaurant.  the steak is good. old atmosphere is reserved, you really feel like you are in a different time, if there are not many customers around. fast service, big steaks!  it can get a little crowded if there is a staples - expo or la live event.	1
food was okay, nothing terribly exciting. the pizza was probably the best thing we ate, and its crust was dry in a bad way.drinks were interesting, but for a place trying to sell you on beer, they had pretty brief offerings and were out of about 3 of them.service. oh the service. we had a waiter that i'd had at bacar before and he was delightful there. here, i don't know what happened. we didn't see him much, had to flag him down a few times (though the food related issues were not his fault) we sat forever waiting for the check and waiting for our cards to be rung up. non-waiter issues on service were worse, we called before we ventured out there, they told us they opened at 4pm for drinks. we got there at 4:45pm, and were turned away, they weren't open yet. maybe you should communicate that with the whole staff. we sat down at our table probably around 5:15, and were told by the hostess, "i don't think this will be a problem, but i need this table by 8pm." honey, if we take more than 2.75 hours to eat pizza and appetizers and drink beers, i'm going to guess it's not due to us, it's due to slow service. our salumi plate came out with just 2 of the 3 items, we had to ask to get our 3rd item. we ordered the bean puree, it never arrived, but showed up on our bill. which brings up the huge bone i have to pick with starbelly's owner/sister resto, beretta. not once have we gotten the bill at one of their restaurants, and not had to check the bill against what we got, what we ordered and what we were charged for. check you bill thoroughly when you go to starbelly or beretta. the bathroom was nice. that would be the only thing that would bring me back. and too bad about our nice waiter working there, i would have gone back to bacar just for him.	0
i was brought here for dinner for a first and officialand  date...very cute and romantic place. the building is charming and view speaks for itself. my boyfriend and i both work in downtown la, so we see beautiful views everyday, but at night time this was perfect. while we waited for our table, we went upstairs for a drink, we were seated on the patio outside, by a fire...super cute and romantic. food was delicious! great place for a date! great vibe, not overly crowded and a great atmosphere and energy!	1
quality is fresh and presentation looks nice but it's overpriced for what you get and the wait time to get your food is way too long.	0
way too expensive for both food and drink, super hectic, loud space; given what i have learned about the modern new york speakeasy style, you're supposed to be paying for a quiet, intimate experience. but instead me and two others were crammed into a corner table with barely room to put our plates down next to each other. not my idea of a good time. the marrow poppers sounded promising, but as they arrived and we realized we had just paid $13 for 3 little pastries, we felt cheated. the cocktails were good, but at $15-$16, our deliciousness/value meter was pretty much at equilibrium.  the only truly amazing thing on the menu was the $45 porterhouse steak, a really good piece of meat that is pretty much being sold at face value.  you can keep the prices the same, and increase the value of the experience, or decrease the prices and leave the experience as it is today. but you can't double dip.	0
consistently good cooking. authentic, not americanized. specials are always a good choice. good service.free glass of wine with yelp is a plus.	1
went to dinner for a celebratory dinner last night with my bf and daughter. service throughout the meal was poor, with our waiter never checking on us to see if we were ok or needed more drinks. food was good - burger very good, grandma pizza just ok - crust was dry and the other pizza we had with spicy soppressata and pickled peppers being the highlight. we ordered two desserts, which took forever to come out, but when they did were worth the wait. the cookie sandwich with butter crunch ice cream was outstanding....until my daughter discovered a giant metal cap 3/4and  baked into the cookie. i had tried to bite it and thought it was a big chocolate chunk so gave it to her only for her to realize it was metal. when we called the host over, he was horrified, ran the cap to the kitchen, then came back to apologize and ask if i was ok. he never offered to bring another dessert for us. when we asked for the check, they took off the two desserts and two drinks and left us a $50 bill. i really felt as if they should have comped the whole bill. a serious medical problem was narrowly avoided whether we could have broken a tooth or worse swallowed this screw. i would have maybe gone back if they had comped us but now never will and will tell everyone i know to stay away	0
severely disappointed. $9 and some change for a mediocre carne asada super burrito? never again! i've never felt so disappointed in a burrito before, as silly as that sounds. lack of flavor. the saucey-ish salsa wasn't that great either imo.. i just prefer the chunkier type. to me, this place is overhyped and totally not worth it. i'd rather go to ........chipotle. =x	0
i went here on one of those coupon deals - in short, i was delighted!great appetizers, great entree's, fun staff - in total, i cannot wait to return here	1
love this place! every friday my coworker and i have lunch waiting for us (we call ahead) because we're always in a hurry. we get veggie pad thai, veggie rolls with brown rice, edamame to die for, and tons of extra spicy mayo because we pretty much drink it. and one of their delicious teas !	1
food is basically the same as the hollywood blvd locations... amazing. however, i still prefer the hollywood blvd. location because the ambiance is better and they have outdoor seating.	1
my family and i love eating at bobby's. we tried it because we had seen them on them on diners drive-ins and dives. their mochi chicken is my son's favorite chicken nugget.	1
so i've been here before they remodeled the place and i really enjoyed their honey wings and wrap. now, i came back afterwards thinking about the wrap and looking forward to having it and they're going to tell me i cant order it because its on the lunch/to go menu. i dont understand why they would modify their menu when it was fine. disappointed and probably won't be back anymore	0
no management. sorry sammies. sorry employees. lots of $$$$ for such a sorry deli. what more can i tell you?	0
good but pricey food.most importantly, the place has cockroaches. need i say more? sigh. if you insist. my coworkers came here for lunch one day and saw two huge cockroaches run across the floor. the waiter quickly stepped on one of them right next to a dining couple while the other one scurried away. this means that there is still at least one big cockroach in this restaurant. it probably reproduced already. gross.	0
my bf and i luckily went here on one of the very few nice days in seattle during the month. because we called the night before, we were only able to get a dinner reservation at 5pm. however, they said they could seat us on the large outdoor patio that they just opened because of the nice weather. also, since it's right in pike place, we got to tour the area and see all the fun shops before eating dinner. very convenient location! we decided to come here at around 4:30pm to take advantage of the happy hour + also get dinner. they were very attentive and accompanied our decision of doing happy hour + dinner. they actually had our outside table ready for the 5pm dinner so no problems whatsoever. between the two of us, we had a wonderful time. i got two house wines (half off at happy hour) and he got two scotch on the rocks. we shared the calamari (not fried) as an early appetizer. soooooooooo yummy. melts in your mouth and has a little spicy kick. we didn't even use the bread while eating this dish...although the bread, once we did try it, was soo doughy and fresh. after drinking and drinking, we decided to order dinner. we got the green lasagne and a grilled shrimp caesar salad. we also got more wine - free with our entrees if we checked in on yelp! the lasagne came out piping hot and bubbling and the lettuce in the caesar salad looked as fresh as it can come. one bite into the lasagne....wow o m gee. best lasagne i've ever had hands down. it looks heavy but the combination of the light handmade/homemade noodles and fluffy cheese...best thing everrrrrr. i would come here weekly just for the lasagne. caesar salad was very good - shrimp was very tasty and my bf ate them all up and he usually doesn't like shrimp.	0
definitely a hidden gem for bay ridge. it's a small place, but it's very nice. it feels like you're eating at someone's kitchen. the chef comes over to talk to you. he prepares all the food, including the bread. service was excellent, as was the food. i'll definitely be back here.  make sure to get a pot of moroccan mint tea!	1
man, where do i even begin? i went here with a group of buddies for a night of wings and relaxation and was truly let down. first of all we arrive there and we are told there is a 15 minute wait, ok, no big deal we will wait. after 30 minutes of waiting we are finally seated, ok, no big deal again i understand the workings and the difficulties in the food and beverage industry. we wait a little longer and out waitress, who happens to have a strange snooki resemblance and complex shows up and takes our drink orders and leaves with an attitude. after another short wait our drinks are given to us by a different waitress helping our table, meanwhile our waitress shows up to take our food orders. that was the last we saw of snooki for the duration of our meal. not only were our drinks never refilled, but we were also never checked up on, nor did our waitress deliver our plates (once again yet another waitress brought the food). lo and behold check time comes around and snooki decides to show herself and act all friendly as if we had been the best of buddies since grade school and even had the and courtesyand  to pencil in 15, 20, and 25% tip rates on the check. hence, this finally set me off and there was no way i would tip such a two-faced and inconsiderate waitress so we pay the bill, and get up to leave. but wait, the episode does not end there, no sir/ma'am, snooki picks up the ticket as we are leaving notices that we and forgotand  to write in the tip and chases me down the end of the parking lot as if i was the jesse james equivalent of the and dine and dashand  bandits. when she finally catches up as i am getting into my car she has the nerve to announce to me that i had and forgottenand  to include my tip to which i responded to the reasons aforementioned for the omission of tip. as i am displeased to report she was not too accepting of this explanation and proceeded to curse me out and use such verbiage that even the and guidoestand  of guidos on the jersey shore would be offended to process through their thick skulls. never have i ever been so disgusted leaving a food establishment that i did not even bother reporting her. either way there is no way i will ever set foot again in this hooters. i would rather watch a 12-hour jersey shore marathon paired along with the non-stop screeching of nails on a chalkboard than see her face again. shame on you.	0
very good, for brunch and dinner. a little pricy for what you get, but consistently tasty.	1
once upon a time, i would have given the daily an amazing review. after my experience last week, never fuckin go there again. main reason is that the current manager is a totally unprofessional dbag. he has loud phone conversations while stuffing his mouth, proceeds to yell at his employees from the table he's sitting at, all while giving everyone else dirty looks. my order took forever, there wasn't even that many people there. the sandwiches were skimpy as hell, mostly bread and condiments. i placed an order to go and never got it, was repeatedly told 5 minutes. i asked to cancel the order (kids chicken tender and fries) after 30 minutes. the manager was a complete douche about it, no apology, no excuses, no nothing. practically threw the receipt at me. on my way out, i noticed one of the employees was 1/2 way through the chicken tenders, awesome.	0
just went again and had an actual meal and thought it was really great! the food is pretty and home downand  ale marinated chicken, braised beef, pasta, pizza but they definitely know how to cook!  really enjoyed everything. but beware appetizers are definitely teeny tiny! i thought the desserts were all great!!	1
amazing! lots of options. fresh ingredients. very nice staff!! i was deciding between soup or sandwich. i picked the sandwich and they brought me a cup of soup with my meal anyway.	1
the only thing i need to say: $1 oyster night. i've been to oyster nights where there are shells and yucky bits or the oysters aren't really the best - the churchill does it right with amazing quality and impeccable service. grilled octopus and fries were also delicious, but next time, we're totally trying the scallops (which the table next to us had - looked amazing!)	1
been to this power pizza location several times because they are right next door to my favorite hookah lounge...and they have never let me down with the quality of the pie. i usually get a couple of slices of cheese on some whole wheat crust and its always fresh and delicious. it's the perfect thing to compliment you're evening when you've been hanging out with friends at the hookah lounge, smoking and having drinks. the prices are super cheap and well worth the money.	1
thoroughly disappointed!   at first, i was excited that the restaurant served filipino cuisine as well as launched by a chef from top chef. also, after enjoying authentic filipino cuisine from the philippines, i was craving a good fix here. however, the general lack luster experience combined with mediocre food did not win me over for its overpriced menu.   even if pig and khao's ambiance is suppose to be a casual experience, their staff did not know anything. we decided to order the 5 course tasting menu for a fix price. for one thing, our waitress, although courteous and nice, did not tend to us as frequently despite the lack of patrons at the place. fyi, we were there for an early dinner around 5-6pm and there was only another couple having dinner. did i also mention how there were 3-5 staff members just aimlessly waiting around? not cool.   the next thing that disturbed our experience was that when we received each dish, the presenter, who was not our waitress, did not even try to explain what we were getting. (even if he did try to explain, he was either on mute or he just explained the meat type.) i even asked for better elaboration on one of the dishes and whether if it was filipino .the presenter did not know whether if it was a filipino dish or what the dish was at all. how is this a tasting menu experience if we don't know what we're trying?   i'm not even trying to be anal about our experience. i did not even try to make it a big deal during our dinner, but after thinking about our experience, i will not come here again.   the second part is that even the dinnerware seemed like cheap $1 items you'd find in chinatown. i don't have anything against cheap dinnerware, but if i'm paying for an ambiance and an experience at a place, i'd expect better utensils. next time, i can just eat at chinatown for authentic food at a lower price.   food was mediocre. it only got 2 stars because our food came out fresh and i liked the coconut rice.	0
(we booked through the reserve app, and that experience was excellent!)flawless food, gorgeous cocktails, and excellent service/staff attitude. ambiance is 1930s french hipster. if you hate wooden hairpin chairs, reconsider, but otherwise there's nothing bad to say about churchandstate	1
well everyone talks about this place, so i figured i needed to try it. sorry to say, i was very disappointed. my husband and i went for breakfast and payed $35.00 for food that was frozen and the re-heated. if you want good food this is not the place to go. way over priced! it reminded me of gas station food and the coffee was sooo bad! the location is great, but food not so, guess i'm not sure what all the hype is about.	0
best looking thai restaurant in all of hollywood food is perfect drinks are amazing all brand-new interior and modern decor yet thai inspired. clean beyond what i've come to expect from a thai restaurant.	1
nope. not a fan. i understand the appeal, but i just don't see it.  at first, i thought that maybe my distaste for the place was due to gage being a more formal restaurant then i was expecting. high prices; small portions: i get that that's how such restaurants are, but hear me out...  if a restaurant is so fancy that it can charge $20 for three scallops and a three-inch line of sweet potatoes drawn with an icing bag, how can it justify a waiter being drunk?  yep. drunk. all four friends in attendance will agree. imagine a creepy james spader character who can't quite keep his eyes open. imagine a waiter who keeps complimenting the ladies while continuously hiccuping. drunk.  so, does this restaurant have low standards for its employees? does it assign the drunk waiter to the table of younger patrons? here's the real question: regardless of why we had this experience, should this restaurant really have such a high opinion of itself?	0
we went here for dinner about a month ago.   we had the samosa chat for an app (cubed samosa with yogurt and mint sauce). it was good but i'd probably try something different next time. seems like it's made out of leftover samosas.  we also got raita which was good but a little tarter than i like. the garlic naan was yummy.   for main courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer. the prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side. the matter paneer had a nice sauce.   the dinner was good overall, but there are better indian restaurants in town.	0
the title says it all. the meat on all the dishes i have ordered tasted old stale dry or too fatty and greasy. covering it with a generous and tasty sauce doesn't disguise the piss-poor protein below. i have found that once your order has been taken and delivered to your table the staff doesn't give a hoot about your experience the quality of your meal and is rather insensitive if not altogether negligible toward the customer. i have enjoyed two dishes here but found three others unappetizing and one down right inedible. i drive by this restaurant almost everyday and from now on i'll keep on driving past it.	0
crappy service. decent drink selection, but we were the forgotten table so it didn't matter. cool location in a dark alley between asian restaurants. ordered food, 20 minutes later told that it was 86'd. other item we ordered was also out. over it by then, time to go to wurstkuche instead.	0
i gave this 2 stars. if i go back and breakfast is killer i *might* bump to a 3.	0
nice atmosphere with great view of dtla. (bar only)	1
i was skeptical about this place because i heard through word of mouth that it was overrated. maybe that saved the meal for me cuz i didn't expect much more than hype. if anything, i was kinda holding father's office burger in the back of my mind as a gauge with which to judge this umami burger.i was dead set on getting the umami burger since it was my first time here, and i felt obligated to get the staple menu item my first time around. however, the waiter informed me that it has caramelized onions and shitaki mushroom inside. i really dislike onions (except in pho and salsa) and shitaki mushroom. and i didn't want to order the burger without them cuz it'd be like going to in-n-out and order a cheeseburger with meat, cheese, and ketchup only (i hate it when people do that - i used to work at in-n-out). so despite my initial plan to order the umami, i went with the pastramimami burger instead. it was so good. the meat is juicy, and it's not like sliced pastrami you get at togo's. it's was a thick piece of delicious, melt-in-your-mouth pastrami like you'd get at katz's deli in ny. like i said, it was so good. also, the sweet potato fries and cheesy tater tots were scrumptious. all in all, the food was awesome. service-wise, our waiter was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. he didn't even flinch when i added items to-go twice. he was always ready to help and was friendly and responsive when we called him over. i'm looking forward to the next time i can make it out to the joint and try another burger.my experience here was also a little better because i saw, met, and took a picture with matthew morrison, who plays will schuester on glee. good times :)	1
great joint to get a bagel and lox, some free pickles, an egg cream, tomato juice, and some huge pastrami on rye sandwiches. basically reminiscent of my numerous east coast dining experiences growing up with a jewish dad. you can have breakfast at any time- that's what i want access to! not in the mood? have a matzo ball soup and potato knish- yum! it's a little weird that the knish comes with gravy, but it sure tastes good. my sister swears by the patty melt.  this place has all the markings of a good deli/diner. always crowded but you're still seated fast; this place is 24 hours and right by cinefamily. nice and clean with a good wait staff. food is moderately priced and my favorite to grab on fairfax after a movie. lots of history here.. seems the older these diners are, the better they perform.	1
and so after one of those fabulous mornings where you run out of the house accomplishing errands i became a bit famished and i decided to finally stop at mikes deli. i frequently pass the small store and never stop, but today my sandwich fix begged for more than a $5 foot long. the basics are like this, they have a great selection of snack valley snacks- you know nuts, trail mix, dried mango and the like. as well as a good selection of kettle chips. sea salt and vinegar!  the sandwhich selection is as extensive as te selection of deli meat they employ. the list of specialty sandwhiches is short, however the condiment list is quite extensive. they even have sprouts! the prices are ok and the sizes are commendable. i look forward to gonig back to try a club on sqauw- i hear it's the cats meow!	1
this place was not impressive.  went here on a saturday around 11 (prime brunch time, i know). there were about 6 of us. the restaurant was not packed, but was crowded. we were told we would wait 45 mins. we were directed to the back deck where we were promptly forgotten about for 1.5 hours. it was about 40 degrees that day so we were less than pleased with our waiting arrangements. after we were seated, service was better, but the long wait left most of our group bitter. the menu gives you the impression that this place is trying to be fancier than it is. the type of place that adds ingredients with french names to look impressive on the menu. when we got our food, my suspicions were confirmed. the portions were small, but the food was well organized on my plate (so that counts for something, right?). my friend who ordered the waffles was the most dissapointed as he recieved a few oversized crackers. everyone's impression of the portion sizes was and are you kidding me?and   overall this place did not wow me. i understand high priced, small portion foods are what some people are looking for, but not at brunch. the quality of the food did not make up for the lack of quantity.  bottom line, if you come here hungry, expect to leave that way.	0
always friendly, always delicious. for miami, especially the sw area you're better off getting a shawarma sandwhich here than anywhere else. definately unlike the offensive ones in kendall... fresh salad, nice soups, the pastries are wonderful.  great little grocery and market with fair prices. theres a reason why this place stands the test of time. i will always support this well run family business.	1
i always browse yelp to find new places to eat, and even though i've lived in kendall for the majority of my life, i always drive by this place on a regular, with little regard that it even existed. i came across it's amazing reviews on yelp and after quickly deciding to come eat here, i realized where my gps was taking me. right around the corner from my house!!  as i walked in, i was immediately impressed. it was cute, quaint, and it's decor was extremely detailed to fit the italian theme. so let's see if their food does the same...  my husband and i sat down pretty quickly on saturday night at 7pm. to start off, we wanted the mozzarella caprese, but my hopes we're immediately let down when the waitress said they were out. what? interesting. it took us a minute to browse the menu, but i had finally decided to order true authentic italian food: bruschetta to start and then the lasagna and my husband the spaghetti and meatballs.   bruschetta was amazing! very fresh tomatoes and the oil drizzled on was just the right amount. perfect. then the lasagna came out, it was just ok. felt the lasagna was a bit burnt on the top and the parmesan cheese on top was from a store bought bottle, not fresh. but overall it was good. but nothing to write home about. my husband loved his meal. thought everything was perfectly done.   we decided to skip dessert this time around, but overall our experience was quite pleasant. nice to have a nice italian place in the neighborhood, that we plan on coming back to!	1
after reading some reviews here i decided to give this place a try....since i also live close by. frankly i was not impressed with the hamburger that i ordered...normal bun and additions. good onion rings though but there are other places with great tasting hamburgers. everything on the menu is a la cart and credit cards are accepted.	0
see, this is the kind of place that shouldn't need to be reviewed. i suppose if you don't live in la and you're visiting and wondering if this place is good, that's one thing. but if you've been in los angeles for more than 6 months and you don't know how good the apple pan is, you should be deported to somewhere like council bluffs and hate your life forever.this is the best hamburger in southern california. this is my favourite place to eat in all of california.a piece of advice, though, if you come here for the first time, make it known. don't try to pretend like you know what you're doing, the service is quick and surly. if you sit down and don't ask for a menu, you will be asked what you want within 30 seconds and if you don't answer him in 10 seconds he'll walk away. because of this, however, you only have to wait 2-3 minutes for your food, and if it's later, they start giving you free stuff. the newest employee has been there for 17 years, and these guys know what they are doing. not mean, just efficient. i love it.don't come with a big crowd, don't come around lunch and expect to get a seat right away, if you're in a rush or are in a big crowd stand near the register and place your order to go. there's about 25 seats total, and even as a party of one you can expect to wait for a seat for up to 15 minutes around noon.i think all of this adds to the experience, and the burgers are perfectly made dressed and served, the pie is fresh and delicious, and the price is right.oh, and don't ask for tomatoes. they don't have them.	1
i called yesterday for take out and went and picked up my sandwich. i ordered the brickhouse club and i opted to just stick with the salad that comes with it...i really love fries...but i don't need them lol...when i got back to work which is just around the corner i opened the box up...the sandwich looked yummy and thank goodness for them i love sprouts because that sandwich was on sprout overload!!! the bread was really good..the sanwich itself was ok i guess...no the best that ive had but nevertheless i ate it....but lets move on to the salad...old wrinkly greens that were bruised and it was so tiny...uhhhh 1 bite and that was it for me...i shoulda got the fries...oh well...another thing that i didnt like was when i walked in there was a dog inside laying on the mat in the front door...now dont get me wrong i looooveee doggies but what kinda made me a lil disgusted is one of the waitresses was petting it and then she went over and refilled water at one of the tables without washing her hands...yuck! anywho...its possible i will give them another shot being as though they are so close to my job but it will definately be a last resort..	0
every dish was remarkable, esp. the tortellini en brodo and the whole fish, service was friendly and well paced, the room modern sort of the barbara bestor look. be ready for some noise like all the very good spots on this side of town. best food in silver lake.	1
i used to frequent this place back in 2009. loved the price and simplicity of the place, but over the years this place has changed not only in service, but food as well. can't say i love eating here anymore. i still go for bubble tea, though.	0
good food for good price. nice find. definitely recommend for when you're looking for not the healthiest meal, but some good chicken wings with a korean twist. i had the fried chicken wings and the kyochon chicken wings and both were really good. not a huge fan of the sauces besides buttermilk ranch. the restaurant can be cold. it's the middle of a hot, la summer and i saw a lot of people in hoodies in the restaurant.	1
i love this place. their food and coffee is awesome.would have given the place 5 stars if not for a couple things.1. they need to get fly nets for the baked goods. people don't want to buy pastries after a fly has landed on it. yuck.2. i've witnessed some unclean practices by a certain male employee. namely, he put his fingers in a to go order he packaged for me. a day later, i saw his push down garbage in a garbage can with a rag he used to wipe down the counters with. i hope management takes these mistakes seriously, it's just plain gross.	1
this was my second time here and i was so disappointed. it literally took about 30 minute to take our drink order, another 20 minutes to receive it, another 20 minutes to take our orders (btw 8.99 steak and eggs is from 6a to 11a only!). they didn't even bring everything we ordered out until we pretty much had to beg for it.  overall it was the worst service i have ever experienced in vegas and the servers had no remorse but then again why should they. 2 stars because their food is good, i'll give you that but at what cost, you know?	0
a delicious disaster.	1
i've been coming here for more than a decade (prior to moving to the west valley). i always order the s-12 (sate' house special) but lately i've been fancying the chicken ruby.   the service is good. food is even better. it could get crowded at times. expect to pay (for two) around $30-$40. you figure tom yung gung for an appetizer, two house special and two thai iced teas and you're set.   only problem i have with this place is that the parking can be frustrating. when that happens, i just go to the one in maplewood and western.	1
i had not visited this chipotle in months so i decided to stop by for a quick meal. the line was long... when i looked around all the tables were dirty, i mean, disgusting dirty. we had to scream out our orders...the guy preparing the burritos was throwing the ingredients like he was throwing darts. i saw some to-go orders being prepared, nasty how he missed to container and some food was out of it. next time i will drive to the chipotle in pinecrest or just go somewhere else.	0
why the lack of stars?!? this place rocks!i have been here twice and mean to go again to try out their 10 dollar bottomless mimosas/wine on weekends. both times, it was for a quick meal before a movie but we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.first of all, the service is excellent. smiles, courtesy, the whole bit. the food is excellent. it has a creative twist, which i appreciate. and they have vegetarian options! this time, we got the roasted cauliflower which had some interesting spices and were good. i dono if they were worth 9 bucks though. we got the veggie burger which was amazing! it had a falafel/middle eastern type taste to it and was served with pita as the bun. i could eat 5 of these! so good! they came with delicious sweet potato fries. i wish they had special sauce to go with their fries given they are so creative with the rest of their food but just ketchup.my dad got the short rib grilled cheese which he said was amazing.save room for the (free with check in) banana creme pie!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is sooooo good!!! it's light and airy with a chocolate crumb bottom and delicious banana. omg so good! and it's free with check in! and they give you a pretty decent slice. i cannot wait to go back! not to mention that it's super close to the theater/mall so you can park in the garages for free. they also have hh which is great!	1
i was looking for spots nearby work that deliver and since la cafe was the closest option, i picked here. i called in and ordered the lobster grilled cheese since so many yelpers recommended it. i called in and since i was paying by card, the man i spoke with asked for my card number, which i was uncomfortable giving over the phone.the $9.99 sandwich + the $2.50 delivery fee + tip to the delivery guy put me out $16. worth it? no. the sandwich came with these deliciously seasoned chips, but the sandwich left me wanting. it consisted of lobster, brie cheese, mustard mayo, and tarragon, grilled with cheddar cheese on white country bread. the toasted bread was so yummy... but there was something off about lobster/cheese combo. i ate half and couldn't finish since the smell and flavor of all the ingredients together was so overwhelming, i wanted to gag. possibly too much cheese?i ended up taking half my sandwich home, hoping to finish later. but i couldn't do it! i didn't want to waste it, so i ate the bread, which was by then soggy and mushy. never getting the lobster grilled cheese again. i'd try other items on the menu, but i'm not in a hurry.	0
amazing place with delicious pizza! everything tastes handmade and fresh, there is a rotating beer selection, and great ambiance.	1
your typical brew pub with a respectable beer selection and a solid pub food menu (burgers, nachos, cheese curds, etc). service was receptive and always made sure our glasses were full. what more can one ask for when in need of beer and a burger?	0
cozy place, deeeelicious food and really, really good service. the fulton sammich was stupendous, the empanada fantasic and the coffee really good. really great place.	1
great dining, reasonable prices. loved the burger (to be eaten with fork and knife) and the gravy fries	1
went with some locals on my trip for happy hour. this is seriously the best happy hour i have ever been to. great deals-i think 1/2 off appetizers and pizza. also, great drink specials! we had the vegan pizza-it was delicious! we also had another one, maybe the margherita? others had the gnocchi and roasted brussel sprouts. both of these are things i normally wouldn't get-but were so good! i am not a brussel sprouts fan, but these were so good, paired with the squash. delicious. additionally, i had the chappaquiddick the crimson cosmo. i have got to figure out how to make the chappaquiddick. that is going to be my summer go-to drink. seriously. also tried the ginger fresh and spice it up. i love tequila, but was scared of the jalapeno in it. it was amazing. just gave it a little delightful kick. go for happy hour! the best deal ever!	1
i can appreciate a good hole in the wall restaurant as much as the next guy but this place is just rundown. they need some paint, cleaning, and decent lighting.   the only reason they get two stars is for the crab and order it to go. everything else my group and i tried was either undercooked (read:raw in the middle) or from a bag not fresh. the shrimp i ordered were burnt and swimming in the water from the veggies on my plate. the parsley potatoes were just okay not good enough to forgive all the other food sins committed at the table.  the lone server was trying his best to accommodate everyone but the poor guy was all alone handling both phone orders and waiting tables. will not return to this location.	0
ha! well, it was inexpensive. that's the one thing i can say nice about this overrated old school nothing of a restaurant. bland as can be. denny's is a far better choice, and i hate denny's. it's hard to describe food this uninteresting. rubbery flat scrambled eggs. sausage from the 1950's. room temperature french fries as your breakfast potato. i can't imagine why anyone would ever come back here. versailles france should sue versailles the restaurant for defamation.	0
came in for brunch last week and had a great experience! first, there was absolutely no wait which is refreshing to see in lincoln park. the space is decorated really nicely, we were seated by a high table near the bar. our waitress came by and brought coffee which was a bow truss blend, it was so delicious. our waitress (and everyone we interacted with at range) was incredibly friendly.   range's brunch menu isn't very extensive, but all of the items are unique and interesting. i went with the maple-bacon sausage omelet and the boyfriend had the morning sandwich. as we started eating, there was no maple-bacon sausage to be found in my omelet. i opened it up to actually see if there was any inside and found two small pieces. i'm not sure if they have the omelet ingredients already mixed and i got unlucky, but it was kind of disappointing. the two pieces of maple-bacon sausage were phenomenal and balanced the white cheddar, spinach, and potatoes so well. the apple mustard and almonds on top added a sweet component, the flavors in this dish were very well thought-out and delicious. the boyfriend really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich, he just kept wishing there was more pulled pork. he had also added an egg, because it only came with one, and felt it wouldn't have been substantial enough to only have one egg.   when we got the check, we were pretty surprised to see the coffee was $3.75 a cup. i understand it's a nicer coffee brand, but i feel this should be communicated before pouring because that's very pricey. overall, range has a great concept and their flavors are spot-on. however, the lack of bacon-maple sausage and pork on the sandwich are elements i think they can work on. i'll be back!	1
i stop by this place all the time! the bread, however, is surprisingly not the draw. the grits, served with a soft boiled egg, crispy thick cut bacon, and jalapeno sauce, is to die for! i've tried other delicious delectable like the chicken liver toast with vinegar blueberries and short bread pancakes with mashed bananas and salted almonds. this is definitely a place to stop by for a easy, delicious, and affordable breakfast! i just wish they would open up an actual sit down restaurant. i would be there even more frequently than i already am!	1
such a fun time anytime you go. wonderful food!	1
food was ok; some good, but music so loud we almost had to yell at each other and very dark	0
amazing spot reminds me of my mothers cooking and the service was really good. make sure you ask for the jou-jou, that's black rice.	1
stopped here on a saturday at 615p and boy were we lucky to beat the crowd! by 630p the line was out the door and to the sidewalk! the cashier told us it would be like that through the rest of the night, and for the 40ish minutes we were there, it was. it was another good sign at how great the tacos might be.  ordered the following and listed them in order of greatness: mahi (with asian sauce) steamed blue crab big and little's (whitefish standard with tartar sauce) samurai (whitefish with jalapenos) spicy thai (my husband also tried the lamb and the hawaiian pork, he liked the hawaiian pork best.)  only problem with the samurai and spicy thai is they definitely had a and fishand  taste to me that made it hard to just enjoy the tacos.  these are semi-small tacos, about 5 bites each, so the price is great. for 7 tacos, as well as the cajun fries and truffle fries, it cost us $24 for a saturday night dinner together, great value.	1
yep much much needed in this neighborhood! this place is so charming i  am personally obsessed with the tiles and the rustic feel.   and the barista who served me knew of one of my other hidden gem favorites - little collins and was super nice to boot.  and this place smells amazing - the coffee smell that all good places need to have.  equally important my iced americano was expertly made and the jazz in the background was super chill and soothing. also this place has a/c but wins points in my book because they don't blast you out with it.  there's pastries here but no lunch options but to me this seems trivial.	1
i had the chicken tikka, and it was very delicious. they were out of the samosas when i went. my only gripe about this place is that the portions were rather small for what i paid for.	1
i've been wanting to check out perch for a longggg time. however, on friday/saturday nights, the line is always out the door. like 45-to an hour wait. i hate waiting in line so i said screw that. i went to a downtown la happy hour meetup event at perch on a thursday night, instead of a weekend night.   perch is definitely a gorgeous spot with beautiful views of downtown la. the drink prices are reasonable as well. i just ordered a beer so ended up paying $6 for a beer. the drinks are definitely less pricer than the standard in downtown. the crowd during the weekdays is more business/upscale. great for groups and if you want to be amongst a gorgeous view while enjoying your conversation!   i have not tried the food yet but would love to come back for dinner or brunch! it would be awesome if perch could build a pool as well. they could generate more revenue that way!   parking tip: there is a lot across the street for $5 after 4pm.	1
my family and i went here for lunch and the atmosphere was a little divey but the food was good. we ordered the 2 ramen combos (one original ramen with ca roll and one spicy miso ramen with tuna sashimi) and an order of garlic fried rice. i liked the original ramen better than the spicy one but both were solid. the broths were flavorful but greasy. the pork melted in my mouth! i didn't like the tuna or ca roll. i thought they were rather fishy. my favorite was the fried rice! they use pork belly in it. yum! i would come back but only for the original ramen and fried rice. service was excellent and parking was easy since they have a private lot.	1
when reviewing (and subsequently giving low stars) i tend to feel bad; in this situation, it's because suzu has clean facilities and friendly employees. at the same time, though, they serve god-awful food. i don't like to dole out 1-2 stars, but the ramen here truly doesn't deserve anything more than 1 star. (i'll allot another for the friendly service and overall cleanliness of the place.)i mean, that's why i came here: for the ramen. i'm in japantown. i don't want any old ramen. i want good, solid japanese-style ramen. the kind that gives you a facial when it's placed in front of you. the kind that has a chewy bite to its noodles, with a soft-boiled egg that adds creaminess to the pork-bone broth. the kind that has flavorful and moist chashu (pork slices), with bamboo and green onion added for flavor and texture contrast.yeah, the ramen here had none of that. with too-salty a broth, an overcooked (and cold) hard-boiled half-egg, sinewy pieces of pork, and bamboo that overpowered the broth, i nearly cried into my bowl of soup. but i didn't, as that would only make it saltier than i could already handle. (and i like salty!)it was a $10 lesson, but now i know to search elsewhere for a good bowl of ramen.	0
absolutely love this place. it's a short walk from my house so super convenient and the staff is always so nice. i love coffee and dancing so it's the ultimate one stop shop for me!	1
gorgeous views of downtown la. overpriced drinks, gross (messy) bathrooms.	0
i like to go to places many times to get to know them before i rate them on yelp. i've been to paper or plastik a lot of times over the past couple years (since it opened!) and i think it's about time i stop.   i'm baffled when i hear people call this a good place to work. the seating is horribly close together, the chairs uncomfortable, barely any outlets if you have computer work to do, and the environment all together doesn't make me want to settle in. the coffee and food are overpriced and overrated, and the vibes from the people are pretty pretentious. there are better coffee joints for me out there. i feel like this is a place i'd only go to anymore as a last resort.	0
mi ga is one of the vendors inside the greenland foodcourt and they serve korean and korean hawaiian plates.   i got a 2 meat plate off the and hawaiian bbqand  menu. it comes with miso soup, rice and 4 side dishes that they let you pick.   the meat jun was tender since they did it quite flat, but there are better meat juns out there. the spicy pork though i really dug. it was a bit more sweet than most korean daeji bulgogi, but the thin slices were tender and i liked the flavor of it quite a bit though it wasn't very spicy. side dishes i chose was macaroni salad, broccoli, soy marinated potato and cabbage kimchee. all were good, but i was surprised how much i liked their kimchee. the miso soup was just the broth, no seaweed/tofu/onion.   i would definitely try more on their menu and get more of the spicy pork.	1
maybe we hit a good night maybe they got a new cook but my first (and not last) trip to harmon's was a great success. i had the bleu cheese burger and their famous fries. never heard of the fries before but they are very good. service was friendly prompt and i was drinking ice tea and the waitress kept an eye on my glass and refilled it without being asked. 	1
located in the heart of chink town, you wouldn't expect to find a low-key, down to earth italian eatery but this spot is a regular on my rotation. nora's is great but i like this place better bc of the atmosphere, service, and food. sundays for coffee and cookies is a must! i also recommend the pizza and all the pastas.	1
i fing love this place! with that being said the food is awesome i've never had a single person complain that i've gone with and some of the people i've taken can always find something to complain about but not here!  well ok sunday we went to lunch and my friend couldn't eat pretty much anything on the menu but that's just cause she a damn picky vegetarian who doesn't like most veggies :p she did love the frys though... so see even she liked it!  another group of us came in monday at 10:15pm and they were super nice and didn't complain that we were there 15mins before they closed. they didn't rush us and we all left extremely happy with a buzz at 11:40pm   plus they serve pbr in a can and a brown paper bag! and the mojitos are rad 2 of them and even some of the biggest drunks i know are giggling like a school girl who just got drunk for her 1st time :p  if your in to some yummy food and good drinks i say go there you won't be dissapoined!	1
i have lived near this place for well over a year and never knew it existed...can't really see anything from the street so i didn't know it was back there. boyfriend wanted to try it so we went last night. super pretty outdoor area...i felt like we were in a treehouse. waiter was friendly and helpful with making suggestions when i asked for his opinion.... i am a picky vegetarian but still saw several things i wanted. went with the pumpkin ravioli w/ sauteed spinach and it was amazing. good wine, too.   we went about 6:30pm and there was only one other table of people but by the time we left it looked like almost every table was taken. will definitely be back...seems like a great place to take my parents when they are in town.  subtracting one star because i think they allow smoking out there? doesn't really feel like you are outdoors, and the tables were close together...yet the dude right next to us lit up a few cigarettes. for real?! ick.	1
$20 for a burrito? don't visit this restaurant for the triple threat. they are obviously not interested in clientele other than their local customers. we visited as we were finishing up a two day trip to sf.. every eating surface was covered in crumbs and spills from previous customers. the staff was very unfriendly, as we were clearly not locals. they laughed at us and sarcastically thanked us as we left. the burrito was ok, possibly worth $8, certainly not $20. i have had much better burritos for $5. don't waste your time on this place. the order of chips and salsa - a bowl with 7-10 chips and a bunch of crumbs at the bottom. the bathroom was disgustingly filthy.	0
i'm writing this after just leaving this place. it was all bad. i ordered the takoyaki, gyoza, and pork belly ramen. my partner ordered the spicy tuna bowl. everything food wise was fine, save for the ramen. it had a not so great texture and taste to me. which i tried to tell the waitress. that's when things went downhill. she was rude. condescending. and just wouldn't listen to me when i tried to tell her about my ramen. i was pretty upset and cut my dinner early, paid, and left asap. i had to go somewhere else for me dinner. it was just all bad.	0
nice restaurant, pleasant dining area, friendly courteous wait staff, appetizers very good, and cesar salad   was delicious, also home made pasta was a nice surprise.. unfortunately, was not completely impressed with main course a seafood medley shrimp, scallops and fresh crab meat, although the seafood was andquot;freshandquot;, was expecting it to be sauteed in a white wine sauce, and it was , however should have been sauteed for much longer leaving the main course to be unintentionally bland ... disappointing given this dinner was a special occasion and luna blu was only serving 4 entrees that night and i was expecting more given prior dining experiences here.. we will be back though.. but not for a while..	0
synopsis of things you should know (culled from the other reviews) 	1
kogi trucks: amazing. chego: solid. pot: meh.  roy choi has finally disappointed me :(. i saw this restaurant mentioned in an article about the best new restaurants in la so i came with my friends to check it out. the restaurant is located inside a hotel, valet parking is $8 for 3 hours with validation - good luck finding street parking! you will spot the restaurant right away since there is a neon green sign that says and potand  in a dark corner.  my friends and i got seated right away though it was very crowded and busy. my friends liked the table setting and bibs provided. the atmosphere here is really loud and hectic.  banchan: green onions, bean sprouts, and cucumbers. no kimchi?! what?! yes, you have to pay extra for kimchi.... sigh  jamaal wilkes: silky tofu, shrimp, clams, mussels, kimchi, scallions, pork belly, egg - not sure if it was just me, but this one tasted kinda funky. the tofu was good, shrimp, clams, and mussels were over cooked and barely any. pork belly was delicious. but the soup/broth tasted funky to me.  beep beep: uni dynamite rice bowl - this is what i came for and i was not impressed. first of all, the and bowland  is more like a tiny plate. i understand that uni is expensive, but dang i didn't expect the dish to be so small. pretty much one spoonful per person and it was gone. the dish was rich, salty, crispy, and for some reason acidic. i would rather not have the acid in there.  oodle your noodle of the day: probably the best thing i had here. cold noodles. very refreshing, light, and full of flavor.  maybe i came on a bad day? this place didn't impress me. expensive korean food. at least i got to see roy when he walked in like a boss!	0
stopped by 4 and 20 on a roadtrip through wisconsin and it was amazing. the place is a little hard to find, it's behind milo's and if there was a sign out front we didn't see it. walking into the cafe there's the bakery section and ordering counter straight ahead and a couple of tables to the left. not much seating, especially if you have a larger party, and it was completely full by the time we left. decorations are really cute, with wall decals, local art on the walls, and fresh flowers on the table. the menu is short and sweet and i was a little worried i wouldn't be able to find something i liked, but we ordered a couple different things and they were all good. the soup of the day was tomato gazpacho and it was delicious. obviously made from fresh tomatoes and paired with cashews, which i've never had in a soup before but gives it an interesting texture. the veggie italian sandwich was the real winner - roasted summer squash, marinated buffalo mozzarella, baby arugula, tomato and giardiniera on ciabatta. fresh cheese, fresh vegetables, slightly crunchy ciabatta, with a slight kick from the giardiniera... it was amazing. and i don't even like squash. the drinks (pineapple lemonade!) were good as well, and top notch service (the guy at the counter patiently answered all our questions and didn't miss a beat when we continued to add things to our order). almost makes me wish i lived closer to madison, just so i could get breakfast/lunch here!	1
great pizza and great staff!! def will be my new fav spot!! and we got a free slice :) def a hood gem!!	1
the good: for a diner, the food is special. great desserts and holy shit, corn flakes with milk! the bad: way too crowded with hipsters on the weekendsthe ugly: they got rid of the fred mcmurray...not cool.	1
came here for a birthday celebration in early december. our reservation was made for 12 people at 8:30pm.   day before the meal the restaurant called asking if they could push back the reservation to 8:45. day of the meal they called again asking if they could push the reservation back to 9:15 but they'd buy the party a round of drinks at 9pm to thank us for our patience. we show up at 9pm and are told that our reservation is for 9:30. no drinks offered. we wait, and wait, and wait. finally after pitching a fit, we sit down for our meal at 10:20pm.   the food is ok but the service remained incredibly slow even though we had a set (and thus limited) menu. we finally left the restaurant at 1am tired, annoyed and involuntarily plastered.   the place is cozy and has a good atmosphere but they really need to get their act together on service. an apology would have been gratefully received but they really didn't seem to give a rat's ass.	0
this is a tough review to write because i used to be a regular at marlow and sons years back and it was the life. the menu is quite the same in spirit, and the food quality is similar. i wont split hairs on the menu or the prices because that's a market/demand thing in my mind. i have to say, i love the very simple cooking, or lack thereof, and don't see why every restaurant with a literate chef can't serve food like this.   what's changed is the experience. the place, in it's popularity, has taken on some rude elements, the sophistication of which is below the pricepoint of the meal. a cultural problem is happening in this restaurant that is probably the fault of the floor manager and maybe the owners? the kitchen is still spot-on and almost deserving of the prices, but not if the service details don't work out. there are plenty of successful restaurants, wildly popular, that keep the front of their houses in check and keep a polite experience, despite the chaos of being a success.   i'd rather a restaurant raise prices in response to popularity than resort to table turning tactics like loud fast post-punk music and other blatantly obvious tricks of the trade (that don't need mentioning to well seasoned new yorkers). we know undercurrents of disdain when we experience it in the details of the service. marlow and sons has turned into a business that's trending toward ruthless. it's still got 80% of it's hospitality machine working as it should, but 20% seaminess doesn't cut it for me at any price. do not ever let on that a customer is just a dollar sign and drudgery; let it slip once and it's a disaster dinner, multiple times and it's a deal breaker.   still, a good-looking crowd, though! anyway, see you in the next life, marlow, it's over.	0
similan is by far our favorite thai restaurant in issaquah and one of our favorites in the greater seattle area (and we frequent them a lot). the food is always fresh and tasty. my personal favorite on the menu is the gingery dish with chicken.	1
my absolute favorite food in madison. layla is just amazing and her place couldn't be homier and better value for your money. if they served her food at l'etoile, i'd be fine paying their prices for this quality food. always amazing flavors and seasonings. i want to see her succeed even though it pains me to think her place will need to grow.	1
man, i really wanted to like this place. i love the decor and it's also not too shabby to study there. the coffee isn't bad. this time i got a chopped salad - i finally got it after being trolled into not getting it last time lol - and there were just too many things wrong with it. i don't think i will order food here anymore. even the table next to me talked about how gross their smoked salmon tasted.. just not fresh.the romaine was wilted and many of them had that cracked pinkish brown marks on the leaves. some even had little tiny dots all over it (i dunno what caused this but the ones that were like that tasted gross). i had to eat some of it because i hadn't had dinner. but man, i seriously hate wilted romaine. it tastes so gross.the avocado was not fresh either. you know how when you leave avocado in the fridge for two long or you leave out for too long you get that brown stringy stuff and the color becomes yellowish? it was like that. i mean there's no harm in eating it but it sure didn't taste fresh. and the cherry tomato... there was maybe one cherry tomato cut into 4 pieces. or maybe it might have been two cherry tomatoes. it was only on the edges of the plate. sliced quarters laid on the edges as decorations. don't bother saying that it has cherry tomatoes when you give me two of them lol.is this as far as they can go with the price range? the price is sure lovely and reasonable but i wished i had gone to la brea instead - while it may haven't been nice to my wallet, at least i would have had a better and fresh meal.	0
me and boyfriend have been to this spot a couple of times...for dinner, for just drinks, and for brunch. pimm's cup is my favorite specialty cocktail. it's sooo good- very fruity and easy to drink. off the menu, the chile relleno is my favorite. i ordered the omelette and my boyfriend ordered the relleno...we ended up switching because i liked his so much more. service is always great here too. another plus- it's a busy environment at night so you can switch right from dinner to the bar which is nice - you don't have to run around hollywood finding the next spot to hang out for the night. everything's right there in one place. i'd definitely recommend this place!	1
i used to like this place for its capuccino and chocolate croissant but the customer service is just terrible. they really dont care about the customer. i waited more than 30 mins for a bagel; and never got it.	0
love, love, love this place! we had the old school pot, the kush (greens), and the bbq veggies but what really blew my mind was the kimchi fried rice.. i could have eaten that bowl all my myself! so delicious!   the music was a tad loud which made it difficult for us to hear or have a deep conversation but the music was on point so we just chose to grub and chair dance. i love the laid back vibe. i love that you get a pitcher or light tea at your table too.   c'mon, roy choi doesn't disappoint .. he is los angeles and i love it!	1
oh my happy hour!	1
this dtla gem is our go-to after a late night sports event or concert at staples center. open 24/7, convenient parking right across the street, and diverseand  patrons and good service from their long-standing waiters in their black ties. this place is old school! the menu is hearty, comfort food and a bit heavy especially when eating late at night but it's not some place we go to that often anyway. breakfast served all day and cash only.	1
laredo's has been an old favorite for many years. we've been countless times, and the service is always good, and food excellent. the bottom line is that you can't beat the good food for the price. sure, you'll find better mexican places in other parts of the country, but this quite possibly could be the best mexican food in town.	0
this place was dang good. we went there for lunch. they have a pretty great lunch deal of an appetizer, a glass of wine, and an entree for $19. we had the grilled artichoke, the grilled cheese adn tomato soup (which also comes with a side salad), and a glass of wine. the sandwich was enormous. it was honestly 2 sandwiches. the tomato soup was just okay, but the salad was good. those artichokes were so good. and the artichokes themselves were good quality. i've had some wimpy ones lately, and these were def not that! also, the staff here was really, really friendly. they were fast, attentive, but also kind of chill. i liked that! i didn't do dessert, but i wish i had because they have s'mores!!!!!!!!!!!!!and the place was super cute inside, though we sat outside. it's la... the weather is great!	1
love lacma, but hadn't been for a while. i will seriously come more often now because of ray's/stark's bar. such an upgrade from the old patina. friend and i hit the collections for a bit, then stopped for al fresco day cocktails and lunch. an awesome way to spend a day.   the cocktail menu is huge and amazing, if not somewhat overpriced. i had one of their seasonal cocktails, can't remember the name unfortunately, but it was fabulous. they were out of the next cocktail i wanted so the bartender whipped me up something specifically to go with dessert. equally fabulous.  squid ink pasta: delicious. flavorful. not fishy in the slightest. i'm a big fan of squid ink pasta and this was up there. only thing was that there was perhaps a bit too much fresh mint, but i loved it nonetheless. if you like squid ink, it's a must order. actually, even if you aren't, it's worth trying. friend i was with had never had squid ink pasta, and he really liked it.   sage pizza: awesome. if i had been more hungry, i'd have devoured even more of this. cheesy, savory, with hen of the woods mushrooms. loved it. will def. order again.   toffee: it's sticky toffee pudding. and it's excellent. i make a great one, so i'm super picky when it comes to stp. this one was divine.  so glad summer is coming -- means i'll be back!	1
this is a better-than-average restaurant with a so-so view friendly service and decent food. it apparently has a loyal following which candidly i don't understand. at this price point there are better options in seattle. yes it's been here since 1950 and is part of seattle's culinary history.	0
tapas are phenomenal here! one of the few genuine spaniard restaurants in miami. the crema catalana is yummy!	1
look, there's not a lot of complexity to the apple pan. you walk in the door, usually wait a few minutes for a spot at the counter, then sit down and eat. but this is a beautiful thing. what you're getting when you go inside is a handful of tasty handmade burger options served simply and with tremendous efficiency. don't let that sound like faint praise, however, because this place is fantastic. everything is wonderfully tasty, served in an atmosphere of 1940s/50s nostalgia. get the hickory burger and a piece of pie--you won't be disappointed.	1
this place is a cute little place. the guacamole was great because the had cheese on it, although the bar was closed so i can't speak for the rest of the food. i got a intense drink that was well worth the money for a ten dollar cocktail.	1
one of my all time favorite places to eat. not only is the venue warm and inviting but the food is as well! everything tastes great from appetizers to entrees to dessert. the wine list is good and even their cocktail list blows most other los feliz's restaurants away. every time i am in town i make a point to eat here.	1
so i arrive before my girlfriend and her friend.. i ordered a simple draft beer at the bar, since i was waiting. the beer was foaming so bad, it was taking two different guys to poor me one beer! it took forever to get a simple beer! the guy was nice and gave me more in my glass, after i made more room for beer instead of foam. this was a bad way to start my first time here, and was a sign of worse to come!very bummed! the food looks good in photos.. there are many great reviews here. but it sucked! i had a starter of the warm monterey squid salad. it was so sorry.. the squid pieces , when you could find any, were super thin slivers.. not rings or chunks.. slivers, almost paper thin little tiny pieces.. with vinager greens and cold potato 'filler'. not even a squid salad.. i lived in monterey bay, and if they had even one whole small 5" squid sliced up in this salad.. it would have been ten times what this was..then i ordered the pork plate, with pork belly.. another very sad dish! the pork belly was a big square slab of fat, yes it was crispy on the ends.. but like a cube of pork fat! gamey tasting as well.. the slices of pork medallions were dry and over cooked.. rubber like! even though they took one meal off the bill, it was still over $150.00 for the three of us. which is not a problem when the food is good!we will not be coming back.	0
i go there for lunch 3/26. the service is very bad,and restroom is very very dirty!! i don't know why "michelin guide recommended" restroom so dirty	0
beermosa -- beer w oj! 5 snaps up! bananna nut muffin ginormous and meaty nuts 5*. seemed like a local joint. bar tender super cool and tv ran football so my date could watch the end. never felt rushed. small place but nice energy. window seats so you can people watch who stumbles out of key lounge. metered street parking that takes credit cards! 2$. nice.	1
this used to be a favorite lunch spot of my co-workers and i. i have to be honest in saying the food is not amazing (especially in a city like la), but the awesome location, decor, super friendly staff and inexpensive fare is reason enough to go again and again and again. as a vegetarian, i've not tried everything on the menu but i can stand by the nachos as a great choice (and think about adding a flight of patron, especially if you're with a group)!i'm not sure if the $5 reward cards they gave us were because they were newly opened or because we went a lot, but ask about them -- couldn't hurt!i would highly recommend this spot if you're walking around in the hollywood area and looking for a quick taco or nachos!	1
alright, so i saw 3 reviews all with 5 stars and my office staff decided to try it. this place is like literally 5 minutes away and after reading the reviews i was convinced we had found our new lunch spot. first negative part about it, food was expensive!!! ok i wouldn't have minded paying a bit more for chinese food than usual if it was delicious but it was not that great. we tried the chicken wings, which were greasy and too big for my liking. the schezuan beef was ok, so was the fried rice. wonton soup was blah. my boyfriend wanted half of a fried chicken (it's a jersey chinese food spot thing) they said ok we can do that with french fries for $12. ok i ordered it, was not half of a chicken, it was the same order of chicken wings with like 1 extra piece, plus the fries were not good. the crab ragoons were horrible, stay away from them! for being a chinese restaurant not a and fast food spotand , pei wei is 95 times better- hands down!!!!	0
bottom line - it's been a couple years since i've been here (and they were in a different location last time), but the food ended up being great, and the service just as good. i haven't been disappointed!	0
great simple healthy food. both vege wrap and grilled vege wrap were wonderful. nice to have a vegan healthy place in the neighborhood.	1
went there without any expectation. a friend from new jersey told me to come here and i did not even realize such restaurant existed even when i pass by it all the time. their milmyun was the bomb! especially during summer time it's a must to eat. i was craving milmyun the next day i dined there.	1
this place was recommended to us by a friend and with being in the hotel we were staying it was close and convenient. there was plenty of space between tables and the place was very clean. our server wasn't the friendliest (just asked for our order and asked if we were done and that was it). my husband got the della's breakfast (french toast, bangers, scrambled eggs, and toast) and i got the omelet with an english muffin, a side of pumpkin pancake and fresh beet juice. the portions were big, filling, presented well, fresh, and delicious! i would recommend for a good, solid breakfast place!	1
this is not intended to be a food truck taco. these are superior ingredients cooked with professional techniques. the food is all delicious. the tacos are fantastic, the chicharonnes and potato skins (fries, really) are fantastic. the salads are solid. if you just come to try a michelada, you may never leave. the micheladas are worth a visit alone. i go all the time and everyone i've brought with me loves it. try it for yourself.	1
this diner represents a past era of la, kinda like the norman rockwell dinner plate scenes. the menu is definitely for the meat and potato crowd and the portions are large. the place gets crowded during the weekend breakfast crowd and on any staple center event. the reason for the norman rockwell reminder is one time i was at the counter and a grandmotherly type was next to me and then next to her was another stranger and when she left for the washroom the guy took care of her tab. when she got up to pay the waiter said don't worry that stranger picked up your tab	1
well i called and asked for a reservation at 8-30. the lady said there was a table open now. i said i could not get there now and asked for 8-30. again she said there was a table now and hung up. perhaps this place is not very customer friendly.   that's the first time someone refused to give me a reservation..quite amazing.	0
this place was supposed to be and goodand  and we had high hopes for it. the latter is the reason why we decided to celebrate my friends birthday there - girls brunch, nice spot, good food. we thought we were set.   for starters, we sit and some of our glasses (for water) are dirty and had to request new ones. people setting the table should really pay more attention as this can gross a lot of people out before even ordering their food. anyways, please note that none of the people in my party are picky eaters when it comes to ordering. however, some of my friends have religious/personal restrictions when it comes to meat. that was the case with one of the girls in our party.   the waiter comes around and takes our order. my friend ordered the eggs your way plate but when it came to the potatoes and the dish all she requested was and no meatand  and that was all - simple right? about 5 minutes or so later, the waiter comes around with my coffee (french pressed as default and delicious!) and an order of some ham and cheese croissants (we ordered 3 for $11 and i highly recommend these!). but, i pretty much finished my entire press of coffee and waited another 20 minutes after that (definitely more than 30 mins from time of ordering) before we saw any other food. so the food is finally coming out and a few servers are helping out pass around the dishes. sadly, the waiters had no idea what was what. they were pretty confused with the orders - but we tried to let it go given we were starving and had waited so long for our food. they handed my and no meatand  friend her plate and when she asked if they were sure it had no meat, the waiter said he better go back and check. so the waiter comes back and we noticed he switched the potatoes to the ones with meat in them!!?! umm, what? long story short, the and managerand  (an unprofessional person who was also playing hostess) comes over after my friend is now pretty upset and tried to say that my fiend asked for the meat and that the waiter was not at fault. all she ever requested was no meat! it's not rocket science. especially after taking forever with our food, they still make us feel like we're a nuisance to the place and blame my friend for the and miscommunicationand  - just wrong. an hour after initially ordering, she gets a new plate, which was boxed up and eventually given to a homeless guy. our party tried to make the best of the situation considering we were celebrating a birthday, but this place clearly shouldn't accept large reservations. they ruined the experience and i doubt any of us will ever go back.   thumbs up for the coffee and croissants, but everything else was a huge thumbs down. makes us sad because it was definitely not and supposedand  to turn out this way given the restaurant's reputation...	0
i like it. it's got that what-a-cruel-world-let's- toss-ourselves-in-the-abyss type ambience. [a counter, stools, and chefs flippin' burgers. the end]now i've seen a lot of bullshit... angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography involving tennis rackets...[but these guys are serious about their burgers and pie]this isn't just a spoke in my menstrual cycle. [these burgers are fantastic!][take a date!] it will be very. the [burgers] will give her shower-nozzle masturbation material for weeks.[apple pan] is god, let's go get a slushie.	1
the old fashioned is the place i go when i am entertaining out-of-town guests, otherwise i tend to shy away from it (and most of the other establishments on the square). however, this past week, after dinner with some friends on the square, we decided to stop by the old fashioned to have a drink and to try the cheese curds (so that we could settle the old debate of who had the better cheese curds: graze or the old fashioned?)	0
terrible! i wish i had eaten at safeco.	0
this place must have changed ownership since i last went as i don't understand all the positive reviews. went years ago frequently until....on my way back to the restroom i saw a baby in diapers on a food prep surface! i was done.......	0
i recently visited the capital grille for dine out boston and experienced a wonderful meal. i checked out their regular menu and it looked amazing. they have an extensive wine list, sold by full and half bottles as well as by the glass. great place to enjoy fine dining. the feel of the restaurant is wonderful. the staff is very professional and polite. there cuts of meat are out of this world! will defiantly come back for a special occasion with my husband!	1
it's right by the water taxi, which can be a fun way to get there. if not, there's parking around (although it can be difficult to find one during the weekend/summer). the view is awesome!	0
have date night every week will be back again.... nice restaurant and great service...	1
it's located on a side street near mlk which is kind of hard to find and limited parking. this is a very small restaurant so i wouldn't recommend planning to eat in here. i ordered the chicken and waffles which was very good. it's no roscoe's but i enjoyed it. this is about one of the only places you will find to enjoy chicken and waffles in las vegas. i'll be back to try other things. it's a little too expensive to eat here on the regular. there was about a 20 minute wait for my food which is quite a bit but overall i was satisfied with my experience. shoutout to whoever posted the picture of the fried catfish and fries plate because it looks super bomb. that's going to be my next purchase lol.	1
we were the first people in for brunch, but it took forever to get our food, and once it came, it wasn't hot. it tasted fine, though.   we split a nutella crepe, but it didn't have nutella. it was just hershey's chocolate sauce. it would have been nice to know before we ordered. maybe they just don't know what nutella is? or don't think that people can tell the difference?  prices are pretty good for midtown. i don't think i'd go back, though.	0
now where did i park the car?	1
checked out this place bc of all the good reviews. i'm now wondering what the fuss was about. garlic bread was bland and worse than what i buy at the grocery store. pizza was okay; perfectly edible but nothing more. it was too soggy to be picked so i had to eat it with utensils. we only had pizza so i can't comment on the other menu items.	0
went here with my boyfriend for dine la. it was a really good price for what you get. it includes a drink - wine beer or lemonade. i got the fred 62 lemonade which is a mango citrus lemonade. really good and not too sweet. my boyfriend got the ipa they had on tap and he seemed to enjoy it. for appetizers, i picked the quinoa salad and he picked the mac n cheese bites. both of which were a lot larger than expected. i personally like food that is presented to me in large portions. they were both good though definitely something you could easily recreate at home. for the main course, i got the salmon with cheesy grits and he got the fried chicken and waffle dinner. the salmon for me was a bit more cooked than i usually like it but the grits were tasty. his fried chicken was delicious! the gravy was light and complimented the chicken and mashed potatoes. dessert is on its way! definitely should check this place out!	1
very lucky!i thought, highly rated thai restaurant is right next to where i'm staying- bonus! ....now i'm curious. i thought i was the master of thai restaurants. is this how thai food supposed to taste like??? have i been fooled by other thai places??? i'm really curious and i feel lost; about why this place has such a high rating.oh!thai iced tea was really good by the way.but their food...i mean it's edible... but has something hard to explain about.the flavor... is.. just.. i don't know.... something's missing."i'm not sure... but you're not.. thai!!!!!"so i don't think i'll go back. bye :(	0
i didn't think the meal was spectacular but it was fast. i love the salsa and chips they put out and the at atmosphere is casual/enjoyable. i think in the evening, it sounds like a fun place but we came for lunch.	0
love this place...prices are steep but worth it!	1
i absolutely love this place, their food tastes like home made goodness! they have a special of the day everyday that is a full meal for $5.75 and it also brings a soup!, it's definitely a steal.   i recommend you try their carne asada with tostones and ask for their chimichurri sauce on the side it is so tender and tasty you will be fully satisfied and your taste buds will love you!   oh to drink they serve this drink called and manzanaand  which is basically a pink apple-flavored soda that tastes super delishh! try it ;)	1
went there at 1 am and they told me they did last call so that aren't open to 2 am.... we couldn't be seated. i can't say much more about it other than you have to find street parking if you don't want to pay for valet in an empty parking lot at one a.m.	0
if you have ever been to tomasita's in santa fe, nm then do not bother going here. if you have lived in new mexico and miss tender burritos packed with beans and swimming in a spicy vegetal gravy of savory green chile, then i repeat: don't bother.because what you get is a soupy concoction of soggy tortilla wrapped around cheese and beans, covered in cheese, and surrounded by cheese. even if you order extra green chile and no cheese, they will still serve you a tortilla log in a greasy pool of cheese.the search continues.	0
****rat alert**** was just waiting for a table a saw a huge rat running around! we all screamed and pointed and the workers just looked up like it was a normal tbibfb. gross! contacting the health department stat!	0
very excited that it's opened in highland park! very cute, reliable italian food, great pizza and chic atmosphere. but i do think it's slightly over priced not because of the location but because of the quality of the food. if they could shave off a few bucks, i would think it's worth it. btw- i'm no cheapskate, i base price on the quality of the food over location and reputation. i'd go back for sure - just not their #1 fan.	1
amazing flavors, wonderful service, small ala carte portions but ended up being the perfect amount of food	1
cute french place in carroll gardens. menu is kind of limited, but we all ordered burgers on a brioche bun. mine had brie and bacon and came with fries-delicious! the burger was thick, juicy and fresh! they have a little outdoor seating area, which is where we sat on that fine day. our waiter had an accent, which made the restaurant have even more of a european feel. yelp said it was a hot and new restaurant in the area when we were looking for a place to eat and i'm glad we went with it! the burger hit the spot!	1
ugh.... we have been sitting here an hour and still no food!!! we only ordered some appetizers. i won't be back, that's for sure!	0
how dare you ruin my boyfriend's birthday dinner, club a steakhouse. roarrrrr!!  i've been planning his birthday for weeks now and wanted everything to be perfect. so i was so excited to come across all the positive reviews commending this place for their spectacular service and decided that this restaurant was and the one.and  boy.was.i.wrong.  the thing is, i'm honestly not even that hard to please and it's very difficult to get me mad. their service--or severe lack thereof-- was such a disgrace that my blood was boiling. they never came to check in on us, decided we didn't need water, and after apps they even decided we didn't need dinner. it took 40 minutes for the main course to show up. fast forward through a whole undercooked then severely overcooked scenario and they actually brought out dessert with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate.   cute gesture, if they didn't completely mess up the rest of the meal. that also means that they actually remembered that we were celebrating a special ocassion and still had the audacity to treat us like second class citizens. unbelievable.   and i was prepared to drop some dough here too. you messed up real bad club a, and i'll make sure to spread the word.	0
gertude's at the baltimore museum of art (bma) is small but has very nice ambience. my party of three had a nice easter brunch there and it wasn't crowded and they even closed the restaurant from 3pm-5pm in order to not have over-crowding. i ordered a tasty mango mimosa and my daughter ordered a peach bellini. she also ordered the waffles which were divine! i ordered the crab omelette. it was ok; i've had better. the crab was good but the omelette tasted fake. my mom ordered the maryland crab soup and a tuna sandwich (boring, i know!)  for dessert, my daughter and i shared a rather tasty berger cookie cheesecake. overall, it was a fun dining experience. they even had an easter hat parade which was cool. i will return for brunch again.	0
i love the huge outdoor patio at this eatery.   the food is good and the service but just the ambiance, right in the middle of the little village at towne square is great. parking is catch it if you get lucky, or walk from the rather distant parking garage. it's worth it, and the interior of the restaurant is very beautiful, too. great choice  for any weather.	1
yum yum grabbed a quick bite here before heading to the theatre down the block. yum good tasty blt or should i say "blat" very filling and tasty will definitely be back when i'm in the area :)	1
loved our evening here.  the filet and sea bass were sublime.  best brussels sprouts i've ever had.	1
i have been coming to this restaurant for exactly 20 years on a regular basis! it is hands down a family favorite and is still my first choice over any other sushi joint. my daughter practically grew up in this place. price wise it's pretty average for good sushi, but the sushi here is great so price just isn't a concern for me when it comes to great quality. a party of 3 will easily cost more than $100 without blinking an eye, but that's eating the good stuff and a pint size kirin beer. they have a cool cash rewards program that gives you $20 off after collecting 20 stamps on your cash reward card. you get one stamp for every $10 cash you spend. you have to pay cash to receive the stamps, it cannot be credit or debit card. basically every third time i go i get $20 bucks off my bill, because like i said before, you easily drop more than $100 every time, especially with more than 2 people in your party. it may or may not be expensive for most sushi lovers, but i highly recommend it! i've had the same sushi man for 20 years and the manager has never changed, and i know it's been there a lot longer than 20 years, so you will definitely be getting consistency!!! plus it's located in the heart of little tokyo, so it's always fun to check out the little shops after a damn good meal!! lol!!!	1
tasty but their version of a face meltingly hot vindaloo is more of a meh. very tasty though and the service was fantastic.	1
the coffee and store itself were great. it's two floors and from the second floor you can look into a dance studio that's attached to the store. interesting and the industrial concept is gorgeous. the low rating is because the employees were just that rude and inconsiderate. work on training your employees in basic etiquette.	0
i went into pds and sat down on a bench and watched and waited for a seat. near the bar was half pitcher of some sort of liquid with liquid soaked napkins dripping on the floor. sitting at the bar (for lack of a better word) were 3 guys in their black leather fags...dirty fingernails, greasy hair and bad beards. the place isn't well lit which is probably intentional. i took out a pie for reasons i stated above...the pizza tasted flat. it was similar to a frozen pizza. location doesn't make a good place to eat, it's the best ingredients and know how of the people in the kitchen.	0
my friend who had brace wires from a fractured jaw brought me here because she couldn't chew so she enjoyed porridge at least.i'm glad i came with her. abalone porridge was a nice serving size, very filling, and just decent.very small space, has an authentic feel of korean mothers touch of home made meals.	1
this place serves a mean tuna melt. it's unbeatable. the cupcakes are very tasty. i also suggest the fruit salad. it can get crowded, so the goal is to get there before everyone else does. it's crowded and after you go there, you'll understand why.	1
i had an order of carnitas tacos, crispy steak tacos and an order of chicken quesadillas here. all were good, parts of the steak were too chewy to be consumed, but the majority was very good. everything is made in front of you. good place.	1
great patio seating!  my breakfast looked like it belonged in a picture! so colorful and it taste just as good. great little corner cafe off of 3rd with lots of outdoor seating.   try the burrito with turkey bacon! waitress recommended and so do i!	1
best sandwich shop in bk? i think so. the bread they use is from some fancy bakery and i think the focaccia is made in-house. the fried chicken sandwich was amazing. all sauces/spreads are made from scratch. i got to taste the bacon jam, which normally comes with their to-go/delivery and brunch boxand  but they were cooking it up at the time i was there and got to taste it-delicious. i think it's also served with the egg salad sandwich.  these guys are legit. way underpriced- get there before they realize.	1
sloppy deliciousness.	1
the food is not that good which is an absolute bummer since the decor /ambiance is so rad. i didn't get all crazy and get gator bc that's something i'd never mess with if you offered me a trillion dollars, but the traditional cajun items like hush puppies and po boys were just meh.	0
i specifically sought out this eatery, because of my gluten/lactose intolerance. it was quite busy when i got there, about 1pm on a monday afternoon. the seating is limited to the right side of the narrow entrance. on arrival i noticed how cleanly the place is, and didn't house any greasy smells. total plus. the man at the counter could tell by my bewildered look that i'd never been there before and assisted me with the menu. he suggested the fish tacos, which i ordered.  2 really well made, soft tacos that are very satisfying to the taste buds. the fish was soft and just lightly battered, and there was a tangy chipotle sauce just drizzled over. obviously made with care.  it's 4 not 5 bc of the cramped seating inside, and for the price i got 2 tacos, which was surprising. but definitely good fast eats.	1
ate here last week while in town for thanksgiving - my friend lives in the neighborhood and loves it - i could see why.people - it's a diner, if you're expecting foie gras and a reduction of port wine, go someplace else. i ordered eggs in the hole, and it was delicious. the hash browns were good (a little greasy, but still tasty). bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly. love that they had mr. pibb available, especially since i was wearing my mr. pibb t-shirt! we closed out the deliciousness with shakes, mine was a coffee shake and it was perfect.	1
if i want to sum up my experience at this place with one word, it would be overrated!they are booked for months for reservations and after waiting faithfully in line before they even opened for dinner, me and a group of about 9 people were seated. however, the waiter hurried our dinner and when we were still sitting after 2 hr, he told us we need to hurry up with our desserts because he needs to give the table to someone else. i understand these people are packed and in high demand, but pleasssse dont be rude to your patrons. the food was good, but nothing special, pizza is way better at delfina or pizzaiolo in oakland.	0
celebrated my birthday dinner here. great atmosphere and good food. i love that each dish is small and shareable, allowing the opportunity to try several dishes.	1
the next time i am scoring horse on skid row i'll be sure to bring my pashmina so that i can cruise through cands for a nice cotes du rhone and french onion soup. my dinner was delish but i thought that some dished lacked acidity. we had a tartine (which was like a pate) of berkshire pork with prune compote. the contrast of sweet and salty was amazing but i couldn't really taste the pork. the onion tart had very small slivers of anchovy which i loved because you got all the flavor but never had to bite into an ugly slimy anchovy. there were also kalamata olives which surprisingly did not make the tart too salty. (note - the tart is huge; bring it home and heat in the oven to re-crisp and top with a lightly dressed mixed green salad!) the bouillabaisse that irene raved about in her lat review was not as flavorful as she made it sound. the broth had no splash of flavor. it was intended that you add croutons dipped in a garlic aioli into the broth after eating the fish out but this ruined the texture of the liquid with chunks curdled aioli floating around. i felt like the broth should be flavorful on its own. be sure to have dessert and/ or a cheese course, they bring a rustic wooden board to your table for you to select. also, their baguette is divine! i wanted more of that for dessert. (its from breadbar). and lastly, service is excellent - knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, yet casual.	1
meh.  was excited after all the great reviews!  i got the steak sandwich. good sized. but not much flavor. bread was chewy and a little stale.  my wife got the cole turkey. it sure tasted good! she was nauseated the rest of the night, which was no fun. dont know if the coleslaw or russian dressing was spoiled. or maybe the turkey.  customer service terrible. we got there around 5p. they were nearly out of all the various bread choices. the folks working there really didnt know what the were doing. one customer wanted a steak sandwich, but they were out of rolls. he asked if they could do it on regular bread. and they said no! seriously? take the steak, put it between two slices of bread, and get the guy a steak sandwich! wow.   here is the box. no one behind the counter could get outside of the box.  i wouldn't go back. sorry.	0
the people from radio bar on south beach bring us their new pop up bar better days right in the heart of brickell. a fun, hassle free vibe with little touches that i like such as: free pool table, fruit infused water, their signature trait popcorn, and yummy well priced cocktails and beer. free cover just walk right in. very laid back yet hip. i came on a weeknight so not familiar with the weekend crowd. check them out!	1
definitely one of the best new mediterranean food joints in the area. i'm pretty picky about my mediterranean food, but their falafel sandwich rocked my world! i added some of their pickled mango sauce and mini pickles....crispy falafel goodness all wrapped in their homemade pita bread.. deeeeeeelicious!	1
petee's just opened this month and i'd be hard pressed to find a reason not to give them 5 stars. i suppose if you're buying a full pie the price is pretty steep but for stopping by for a slice, $5 is a reasonable price. the girl who helped me was incredibly friendly and sincere and the whole little shop really gives off a great vibe. there's only a counter with a few stools but i'd imagine most of their business is to-go. i like that the entire business is open so you can see all the magic happen, and make no mistake, magic is happening here. the pie flavors rotate with the season (i'm assuming) and to some extent, the day. i tried a slice of their already famous chocolate chess pie as well as a slice of the apple cranberry. the chocolate chess was basically like slightly more firm brownie batter in a pie form. it was amazing and not too sweet or rich, it was the perfect balance of sweetness and chocolate flavor and texture. the apple cranberry pie was also perfect, possibly the best i've ever had. the crust was perfectly flakey and buttery without being too dry or too much. the apples were the perfect combination middle ground of firm and soft while there was no goopey canned gel type stuff you sometimes get with apple pie. there weren't many cranberries, just enough to give the occassional tart note. i can't wait to come back and try all of their traditional and non-traditional pie options. petee's is definitely going to make keeping my new years resolution challenging because i want to do nothing in moderation when it comes to pie.	1
came in the other day from a recommendation of a good friend- i was really excited upon entering- the vibe is extremely chill and inviting, with an awesome opened space and killer artwork. i tried a bunch of things... some highlights included, the pork buns, brussels sprouts and this heavenly piggy banh mi. well done, you guys!	1
my friend and i wanted a quick bite after our griffith park hike, so we stopped in here. we ordered some tasty alcoholic beverages, which came out in huge diner glasses!! score! we also ordered nachos, which were the coolest nachos i've ever had. all the toppings were piled on each individual chip! there was no digging into a mound of mush, no nasty, sloppy fingers, no soggy chips left at the bottom with no toppings. i am absolutely going to make nachos like this for my next party. so smart! we also got a cobb salad, which came out looking like ceviche, all neatly piled up on itself in a square. equally delicious.	1
pizza was delicious and light. not greasy and heavy like other chain pizzas. we ordered the fourth horseman which they give you an option of ranch base or marinara (we chose marinara base). the pizza was delicious, the crust had herbs mixed in which gave it a great taste. i usually skip eating pizza crust but this pizza had me wolfing down mine!   my nephew had ordered a calzone with his choice of two toppings. he got pepperoni and italian sausage which was a bit spicy, what a great indication of the quality.   also the root beer floats are served in a chilled mug and were darn good. all for $3, this totally beats johnnie rockets! this place is located in front the metro gold line, easy to get to. the only bummer is the parking, they only have a few (i think less than 5) spots and they fill up pretty quickly.	1
food was great , but the service was over the top. first class, everyone made you rite at home.and was very friendly.	1
great ambiance and vibe. very cool hotel and beautiful, breezy restaurant. our waitress was actually the best i've ever had, and as a former waitress and chronic patron that title doesn't come lightly. i wish i remembered her name, but to the smallish, brunette zany girl: you deserve a raise.i'll certainly come back to commissary, but the main reason will be the overall experience not specifically the food. i enjoyed my fries (but nothing too special there) and the eggplant was good but too spicy for my taste. alos, call me basic, but the picture ordering freaked me out too.. i like when i know what's in the food i order without having to ask about every single one.	1
food's awesome. understand it's busy. no need to be a douche on the phone. i get it, you're busy. sucks when a chill place gets pretentious.	0
we moved close to ktown over a year ago and have been eating our way through every korean soup and noodle joint ktown has to offer ever since. this is definitely one of the tops on our list.they've got all the random beef parts that my husband loves to eat and i have grown to love as well. their oxtail soup is very tasty and perfect when we're too lazy to make it at home. as a soup maker at home, we know how hard it is to create a clear broth full of flavor, the mark of a well crafted soup. it requires parboiling, cleaning the bones thoroughly, and them simmering slowly on low heat for hours to achieve perfectly clear broth. don't forget you have to strain it too! it takes hard work!	1
i had a bill last night for 20 dollars which i put on my credit card. we left a cash tip, so my card should have been charged for 20. but this morning when looking at my online statement, it shows that i was charged 24 dollars. listen, i'm not one to complain about 4 dollars, but that is straight theft. we left the waitress over 20 percent in cash, so there was no need to put extra tip on my credit card. she was a female waitress probably in her late 20s, with dark hair and bangs. i will be calling the restaurant today to let them know about this.	0
being half honduran, i grew up with the wonderful food of my father's homeland. i remember my two aunts in the kitchen making tortillas and re-fried beans from scratch while the excitement built up inside of me. it was time for baleadas, a sacred right, and paseo catracho is the closest i've ever come to re-experiencing that feeling since my childhood.  for the uninitiated, a baleada is a thick, oversized, handmade flour tortilla which is filled with refried beans, crumbled cheese and cream then folded in half. this is the simple version. you can also add carne asada, eggs, chorizo, or all of the above for a super baleada. my favorite is with carne asada.  the dishes at paseo are delicious and very authentic. their sampler is excellent and, frankly, underpriced for the quality and quantity of food you get. it comes with chips in bean dip with melted cheese, two flautas (rolled, deep fried tacos), carne asada, cerdo asado (pork), three mini pupusas, and half of a stuffed sweet plantain (stuffed with refried beans and cheese.) it will easily feed four people without a main dish. if you still have room go for a baleada. wait, eat one even if you don't have room! stuff your face! or just take one to go. they're excellent. besides the baleadas, the pork is mouthwatering and definitely worth trying.  not five stars?  i've been to this restaurant twice and both times had an issue with the service. it took way too long for the server to bring us the check and even longer to bring my card back with the receipt for me to sign. this might seem petty to some, but i can't stand it. on the second visit my sister's order was never placed and by the time she finally received her food the rest of us were done eating. despite these inconveniences, i will definitely keep going back. give it a try.   now!	1
this place has the worst service. the waitresses there are rude. they always look like they're mad at you and they don't acknowledge you from the moment you step into the restaurant. i've eaten there and gotten take out from here a few takes and each time was unpleasant. i usually go there when i'm sick and want comfort soup and you especially don't want to deal with rudeness when your sick. i've only went back and gave this place 2 stars instead of one because the food is good. pretty fed up of feeling unwelcome there. i will not be returning anymore. there is a buil samgye tang on 3rd st that taste the same with much much better service.	0
went for hibachi with my gf. it was my second time going to osaka. first time was amazing. this time we had a really poor hibachi chef. he wasn't as entertaining as i hoped he'd be. was really messy and rice was flying around. it was also very crowded and they may have been under staffed so probably a hit or miss when you go. definitely make a reservation though, although even if you don't the max wait time is 5-10mins. not bad at all.	1
i was so excited to try this place out given the reviews i saw on yelp, and i had to say i was disappointed in the food.   my girlfriends and i ordered the and mac and cheeseand  and corn breadand  and fried green tomatoes with pimentoand  and maple bacon donutand  and of course the and fried chickenand   the mac and cheese was nothing spectacular, and i always order a mac and cheese to try out in every resturant i go to. my top places for that is table 34 and yard house! yumm yumm  the corn bread had real corn kernels inside the bread with a lime zest whipped butter. the kernels were rubbery. didn't taste fresh.  fried green tomatoes with pimento and bacon need some acidity to the plate. so i added a squeeze of lemon wedge and it tasted better.  the maple bacon donut, ohh so sad.. it was so doughy and not enough glaze and bacon for the whole donut. we all had one bite and left the other half. they should make 3 mini donuts instead of one large one.  i saved the best for last! the fried chicken is definitely the star on the menu from our order. juicy great flavor and breading! it is yummy!!	0
located in the former salad and co. location. sandwiches here are fresh and their boba tea is also yummy. my fave is the jasmine green tea and maggie's club. i order or pick up from them often and wait time varies if they are very busy. at times, ive waited up to an hour for delivery. if you are in the area, check them out.	1
i just found my favorite italian restaurant! great pizza just like in italy with crust perfected!  their eggplant parmagiana was also different. although the eggplant was super soft, the mozzarella cheese in between was chewy and i think they cooked it with their own fresh tomatoes. there were tomato peels here and there.  nice accommodating staff though. we shall return!	1
excellent service from autumn. unique dishes that can't be found on every corner of town, such as delicious beef patties and yuca.	1
love this place. lots of great casseroles and great vegetarian options. everything from the mac and cheese to the vegetarian pot pie is amazing. absolutely love this place...spread the word, people!	1
went a few weeks ago for dinner with friends before attending a play at a local theatre in the area. i had the ahi tuna sandwich and enjoyed it, very tasty and followed it up with a delish brownie with nuts - yayyyyy - i know that more and more people are allergic to everything and i feel like those of us who are not allergic to nuts suffer so thank you toast for making brownies that include more than lots of chocolate and nothing else. decided to give this place another try and this time, had breakfast this morning and it was just okay.......had the salmon and cream cheese egg white omelet and the salmon was overcooked and the two blocks of cream cheese jammed into the omelet did not melt and just sat their awkwardly staring back at me, so i removed it and sat it to the side.  will not order that again but the banana nut muffin was good but the highlight of my day was when i saw magic johnson and his lovely wife pull up a table right behind ours.	1
i may have messed up my taste buds for korean fried chicken in new york comparable to k-town la's korean fried chicken, cause this was very mediocre.overcooked and too much batter where it ripped and cut up the inside and roof of my mouth. the spicy hot wings were good. the blend of sweet spicy was missing something, but i still ate it, just couldn't figure out what it was missing. got honey wings, garlic soy and original. they all tasted the same. i think their variety of flavors weren't really a variety, they all kind of tasted the same with the exception of more batter piled on. the salad was very bland.eh. i think it is all just hype for being the most popular fried chicken in k-town, but there are always better ones.	0
this is a great restaurant that blends an intimate feel with top notch food and drink. the staff are friendly and knowledgable about their dishes. there is great flavor and excellent presentation. i will definitely be a regular here.	0
great bar to grab a drink and hang out with friends. i love that the entrance is on the side and you have to walk down a small alley to get to the patio area. lights are strewn across providing a nice ambiance. when the weather is nice, it's fun to sit outside under these lights and chat with friends. drinks are reasonable and it's fairly easy to get your order in. one night we weren't able to go inside since they had a private event going on, but it's all good, hanging outside is way more fun anyway!  all these yelp reviews are talking about food, and i really need to get my butt back here to try some wasabi fries! ahhhh!	1
went on a date. menu looked great (farm to table ish) but everything was a little disappointing. way too expensive for what it is.	0
grubstake... grubstake... grubstake? man, it seems like every single time i party with my buddies in the city, they take me to grubstake at the end of the night. i've been several times and for some odd reason i haven't written a review on this place. oh wait, i know why. it's because it's not that great and i usually forget about it the next morning for two reasons. 1) i was really drunk the night before and 2) some of the food is borderline atrocious. without getting into too much detail, i have to admit that i am a fan of their potato skins and link sausages. these two items make perfect drunk food. the potato skins are loaded with a ton of cheese, bacon and sour cream. they're greasy and heavy - a perfect way to help tame your hangover the next morning. the link sausages are pretty good too - nice flavor, great snap to them and a tiny bit of heat. with the positives behind me, i have to talk about the negatives. never in my life... and i mean never in my life have i had wings as terrible as the ones at grubstake. they call them portugese buffalo wings, however, i kept calling them bush league buffalo sh*t. i can't believe they have the nerve to keep this on their menu. the wings have absolutely terrible flavor. i have no idea what kind of rendition of "buffalo wings" these are because they taste like, well, sh*t. the worst part isn't even the flavor, it's the texture - dry and grainy. so disgusting and fowl. i'm pretty sure these wings suffered from major freezer burns. what pissed me off the most was that when we asked the server if their wings were any good, without hesitation he said they were "excellent". get it together man!!!some of the other not-so-great dishes include their terrible sauteed shrimp with garlic, the oil injected onion rings and their horrendous cream cheese poppers. what really gets me thinking is how much worse the food would taste if i actually had the balls to eat at grubstake sober. i'm pretty sure if i did i'd end up being underwhelmed by the potato skins and link sausages! the only reason i didn't knock their rating down to 1 star is because, well, me being drunk every time saved their @ss. let's not kid ourselves, food taste better when you're drunk. it's not a secret! i seriously think the peeps at grubstake opened the place just to serve sh*tty food to drunk people. they were probably like "hey, i have a great idea. let's open a restaurant and serve bad food to the drunk and disorderly. they'll eat anything!"... ... well, that's partially true.	0
the service is terrible and the owner is a dick. food taste good but extremely over priced and they don't serve enough on a plate.  if your the type of person who eats more than a mouse and don't like to be talked down to, then stay away from this restaurant.	0
short rib hash is delicious! ask for candice, she'll navigate you through the menu! honestly i think more like a 4.5.	1
wow - it's literally like walking off the streets of la and into a fancy french bistro with an nyc vibe. you almost get a feeling like you're outside - it might be the hanging lights and cobbled floors, but the mood is right for a romantic date - or a night out with friends who enjoy the finer cuisine.the wine selection was all french - and that's not a bad thing! my two friends and i had a hard time choosing but ended up with amazing short rib, cassoulet and bouillabaisse! and of course we had to have an oyster sampler to start with...they also have great cocktails..	1
i love this spot. their cassava cake is soooo good. i love how friendly both the server and owner are. not a scene, just a quality coffee shop with pleasant service!! very reasonable pricing as well. thank baby jesus for this spot.	1
super impressed with the speedy delivery. i ordered and my food arrived in 20 minutes. amazing. i would give it five stars but my sandwich is cold so i'm assuming this was premade :/   thanks though!	1
best martinis in madison. tasty drinks (beer choices for those more inclined) -try the butter up kim for a martini.	0
the service here was just not good. one male bartender was nice to some of patrons, but the rest of the staff was just plain rude and inattentive. the food took forever, and i imagine it would have actually been delicious (reason for two stars instead of one) if it was brought out hot instead of room temperature. the place would actually be a great neighborhood gem if they just had staff that card anything about customer service. side note... they do not take credit cards.	0
arby's, your days are numbered. curly fries, cooked in beef fat! also, the beef here is tender, and the rolls are perfect. to add to this, there's also frozen custard!i will update more, after my excitement subsides!	1
so delicious! wonderful vibe! great for a date or a brunch. the burrata salad was joy to my tastebuds. i also thought the proportions were generous and the pricing totally fair. the food was just great. i wanted to try everything- a great menu. brahm, server there, was right on with his recommendations. i can't wait to come back!	1
this place was a gem. awesome menu, fresh food, light, flavorful and low fuss. i loved that you could eat there (2 outside tables) or take it to go - a sweet deal especially if you're staying at the holiday inn across the street.  all the dishes we got were top quality - the sides were awesome - especially the berry-wheat salad (it was an eye opener for us). when done eating, we were stuffed, had left overs, and didn't feel heavy or bloated.	1
i can't get enough of this place. the waitstaff is super friendly, the food is amazing (arepas de choclo are okay, but their cheese ones are to die for), and the ambiance is super casual/non pretentious.  need more evidence of its greatness? i've seen myself coming out of way down brooklyn or the bronx more than once just to have their arepas. look, places like caracas in wburg/east village have good offerings.... but the no-nonsense, non-pretentious, out-of-the ordinary feel that this place provides (plus the quality, which is far superior) is a killer.	1
we arrived about 10 minutes late, my fault for underestimating traffic on a saturday night and getting into the mall. i apologized when we came in at the hostess station and we were shown to a table that was closer to the food prep area and a bit separate from the dining room. we asked if we could be seated in the dining room area, there were a few open tables, and the person who had walked us to our table went back to the hostess station to see about changing our table, we followed and overheard the hostess respond to the request with andquot;what do they expect, they were lateandquot;. it was not what was said so much as the tone which it was spoken. while where we were seated was very loud and we looked out into the mall, the upside, our server was incredibly pleasant and patient of my friend's dietary restrictions and questions. the food was excellent and service was quick and professional. we will most likely return at some point, the proximity is very convenient when you are shopping or going to a movie. i will make sure to request a table in the dining area next time and hold out for this.	1
i've been to this restaurant a few times, and if i had thought to review them then, it would've been 4-5 stars easy. today was the biggest disappointment. i had family from out of town, they were looking for a good veggie burger, and i knew this would be the place.  when we were seated we were given the brunch menu, which is fine, it is a sunday. i asked if there was any way a veggie burger could be an option, our server and kyleand  declined. he should've stopped there, but he went on to recommend a lobster blt. first of all kyle, lobster is a crustacean, second of all the b in blt stands for bacon, neither of these two foods are part of a vegetarian diet. granted this is a burger joint, and most people just assume all burger lovers want a meat option.   the dilemma only continued, it took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, which were great. we then received ice cold hockey puck biscuits, now as a southern girl i do consider myself a biscuit connoisseur of some sort... the biscuit was great, but would've been all the more better had it been hot, and had it steamed a little as i cut into it, but, no, no steam, just a cold biscuit. 45 minutes after our order had been placed, a group of people sat opposite to us, as they did, kyle let us know that our food was coming out in a just a minute, in fact he had seen it in the window. now kyle, since you had been able to see our food in the window why did you not carry it out to us?  well, 20 minutes after kyle had let us know our food was on the way out, still no food, some man, i assume the manager, came out to let us know that they were out of bagels, and would a burger bun suffice? after this man offered, the table that had been sat 20 minutes ago received their piping hot food.  now, let me review all that has happened with us, 15 minutes for a drink, 45 minutes from that drink being on the table for our server to say our food is on the way, 20 minutes after that someone comes to tell us one of our orders is no longer available.   thankfully, i come from a family of optimists, and although we were clearly perturbed by this entire experience, we continued to try and make the best of it, even by creating a vegetarian meal out of a toasted burger bun, lettuce, and a tomato.  over all the rest of the meal was enjoyable, like i said, i've been here a few times and have always left a happy customer, unfortunately today was not the case.   as a former server, when i dine out, i expect to receive the level of service i gave people, which at the end of the day, is kind attention, without being overly invasive to the enjoyment of their meal. however, i would never allow someone to sit and wait 45 minutes for food, i would not tell them their food is coming right out, only to have them wait another 20 minutes. meanwhile some other table that has been there only for 15 minutes receives drinks and food. i also would not tell you your food is coming out, only to be followed by someone saying no, it's no longer available. 1 hour and 5 minutes to say it's no longer available is unacceptable. i'll also say, as a former server i know, that when the items are below 10, a little number pops up, to let the server know this is limited. if our order went in, no problem, then that bagel should have been ours. i imagine somewhere in the hustle bustle of the kitchen someone nabbed the bagel. which fine, it happens, i get it, and it's not always in the control of the server, however, you should have a better alternative to offer than a hamburger bun. unless it's a hand crafted kaiser roll, i don't imagine most people go out craving to eat a hamburger bun.  i think it'll be a while until i return here, as this was pretty disappointing...  also, for kyle, a lesson on what it means to be a vegetarian. vegetarians eat vegetables; some vegetarians eat eggs, and dairy products. vegetables grow from the earth; they do not walk, or have eyeballs, or any sort of organs. pescetarians are people who classify themselves as vegetarians, but also eat some fish. now, kyle, if we say, and i'm a vegetarian, there's no way i can get a veggie burger?and  if the answer is no, just say no, don't offer me a sandwich with both a crustacean and pork.   you were lucky we're kind individuals who have all spent time in the server industry. we left you a 30% tip, which i will flat out say, was not my idea, nor the idea of the man who ended up with a hamburger bun as a meal, i think you deserved way less than 20% or even 18%	0
this is going to be my new favorite place in the neighborhood. there's precious little that stands out on this stretch of hollywood blvd so when the crappy thai place shut down and the signs went up for ramen i was hopeful. and it was like mana from heaven. the food shows way more attention to detail than the interior decor does (avoid the temptation to act out weatherman jokes against the key green walls) and is done perfectly. i had the shio butter broth ramen and it was so good i was practically mad at it for being so damn delicious. all smiles for service, eager to get the word out, and an almost shockingly modest price. most restaurants fail in the first year, this place deserves to be a hit, and maybe they can re-paint the walls and put that tiny soundboard i saw in the corner to some use.	1
dined at bazaar meat last night . service was very slow!! the food took forever to get!! even the wine glass and  gazpacho shot!! mostly ate uncooked food - so it just doesn't make sense to wait for so long !!!! power went off around 9:40 pm so for about 15-25 min we set in the dark.. got the steak we ordered prior to the power failure an hour later. no compensation offered , only one short very insufficient not honest apology from our patronizing server...   very bad experience overall.. not worth the money would not recommend to anyone.	0
one of the best thai restaurant taste wise i've been... i am always a fan of their shrimp fried rice and bbq beef skewers especially with the peanut sauce. also, the beef panang, it's delicious.yet, service is a little bad due to the lack of staff, too noisy since mostly large group comes in here as well as large families. otherwise, food meets great value.... i will always come back on this place.	1
this is still one of my favorite steaks ever. i love nice steakhouses (ie, mortons, craftsteak, etc), but this is still one of my favorite places of all time. i dnt know what it is...maybe its just that they cook my steak perfectly every time and there is little seasoning beyond the 80 years of goodness on the griddle. and where else can you get a good sized ny steak for less than $20?i always go late night after dodgers games or concerts at nokia, so ive never had to wait in line. i dont live in la, so weekday breakfast isnt really an option. ive heard good things about breakfast, but never had a chance to experience it.i also love the whole experience. you walk in and the place just looks kinda dumpy and old school, but then you are greeted by elderly gentlemen in vests and bow-ties that have probably worked here their whole lives. i dont know, the history and atmosphere just add to the the experience.so yeah, if people come here expecting fine dining, they will be disappointed, but if you just want a good, old-fashioned home style meal for a good price, youre in the right place...	1
good food. will definitely come back. the only thing bad i can say is that the servers like to chat with regulars in the dining room and we pretty much heard everyone's life stories.	1
if you feel like overspending on chicken wings that are mediocre in flavor, then go ahead. this place lacks value and especially customer service. i had so many complaints from my friends about this place. you are paying for the branding, not the food. everything is pretty much ala carte and have to pay for it separately even the side radishes. there are so many other chicken wing restaurants around so check them out instead.	0
snobs and bad communicators. myself and the mrs. went there for a pleasant sunday brunch, only to be told that they only take reservations, or accept guests of the hotel. this, despite the many clearly empty tables in prime brunch time (a little after 12), and the complete lack of notification until we got there. seriously, is it so hard to post a policy on the restaurant's web site? the only indication is the reservation selector on their home page... but at no point do they say that booking is required. so it was a wasted trip for nothing. instead, we spent our money at one of the many local competing restaurants that actually seemed grateful for our business. this roof might have a nice view, but that's not worth dealing with snobby people who think this can paper over bad management. find somewhere else in this neighborhood to eat; there are plenty of good places that actually welcome your business.	0
five stars for the cocktails (anything with fruit and herbs and insanely fragrant cucumber that's properly mixed on a summer day gets 5 stars from me) and 3 stars for the food. i had the margharita pizza and it was good--nice crust and tasty sauce--but nothing extraordinary. it is, however, a fantastic place to sit outside and enjoy the day after seeing some great art.	1
so many flies!!! we were being attacked from all angles, it was a real turn off!  the wait staff is fine, nothing to note either way.  the brunch menu is small but satisfying - i personally recommend the eggs with potato gratin. but the rest of the menu is supposed to be 'asian influenced.' it was more asian than french cafe.  also i hate little hole in the wall places that are cash only with no bank anywhere near them. $5 atm fees are not cool!	0
we had two appetizers and split the lamb shank, plus desert.  just right, and if you come early it is quiet.  a good start for a pleasant evening.	1
the worst mexican restaurant i've ever been to. terrible service (waited over an hour for our food) and even worse food. they sell and margaritasand  that are wine based and have no tequila. the drink was watered down, full of ice and 8 dollars with no tequila. the atmosphere was like a high school cafeteria. probably the worst mexican restaurant in miami. i guess they have family and friends posting yelp reviews. all around awful experience.	0
called ahead to get reservations for a birthday and asked about dessert option presentation for a birthday.they told me they had a metal cake.with fireworks coming out of it.what is this...luna park has a great intimate and fun feel to it. i got the volcano scorpion bowl and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream.working out with the hostess on how to sneak in the surprise cake was fun. the people were very nice and attentive, with great attention to detail. when the cake came out, it looked gloriously scary - in the best way possible.didn't have the chance to try their other food though, just had dessert and drinks.the chocolate cake was so soft and warm - the perfect bite with some ice cream on it. the scorpion bowl was big, with a shot light on fire upon presentation. strong and sweet drink. could have finished it, but had to drive safely.and - after all this trouble, they took my expired living social coupon! i asked about it and they said that they don't believe in the expiration dates. awesome!great service. fun people. romantic atmosphere. metered and valet parking.	1
i was excited to try vinegar hill house as i like freeman's food but i don't love the attitude. i thought a brooklyn version would be an improvement, but sadly i was wrong.  we ordered a bottle of wine at the bar and were brought a different bottle. when we said it wasn't correct, the bartender questioned us before determining that it was in fact not the bottle we ordered.  once we were seated at a table the waiter greeted us with a and sup?and  and then asked what kind of water we wanted--but didn't bring us water until our meals arrived 30 minutes later, even though we requested it three times.   the food was good (excellent charcuterie plate), though the chicken was not entirely cooked. when the waiter saw i was examining the uncooked chicken, he walked away. he never checked back to see how our meal was.   the restaurant is located on a really pretty street in brooklyn and the atmosphere is nice, but the service was terrible. i think you can find similar food in brooklyn without having to put up with the terrible service and attitude. when is the too cool for school vibe going to die?	0
i probably should have researched this place before going because it was not at all what i expected. to be clear: diablo tacos is not mexican food. it's an experimental, creative interpretation of mexican food -- which is totally fine, except for the fact that all of the dishes we ordered were a huge disappointment.there were only about three taco options. i ordered the "fried chicken" taco and my friends ordered the pork belly taco which had some creative ingredients like banana and thai sauce that scared me away.the fried chicken taco was just ill-conceived. fried chicken is great standalone. you don't need to wrap it in a corn tortilla and sprinkle lettuce on it. as for the pork belly, my friends were very displeased; and they are the types to get into weird, experimental food.i also ordered a "salad" which basically consisted of large chunks of radish, slivers of cucumber, and a few pieces of jicama doused in the most unbearably spicy and sour chili lime sauce (worse than tobasco). i could only get halfway through the salad, until i decided to just rinse the vegetables in my glass of water, so that they could actually be edible and not gag-inducing.then i went home and ordered a pizza.	0
mmmmm.....soup = oknoodle = not a japanese noodleegg = "half boiled egg" is misleading... when japanese hear it, we think it's "half-boiled, egg". not "half of the boiled egg". since ramen has to have half-boiled egg, it's kinda fail.menma (bamboo shoot) = it's a chinese one, but since chinese makes menma far better than japanese, i guess it's ok like that.red ginger = i ordered tonkotsu. tonkotsu has to come with buttload of red ginger. not two shreds it's not a (ok kind of but oh well) rocket science to make a good (not great) ramen... why none of the restaurants in san francisco does it "good?"as for okonomiyakicabbage = wtf? 70% of the okonomiyaki has to be composed with cabbages. it's not an expensive material.. why so little of it?red ginger = it should be in the dough. nori on the top = it's not necessary mayo = more pleaseokonomiyaki sauce = more pleasebonito on the top = more pleaseao nori on the top = more pleasepork = okonomiyaki should be based on thin sliced pork or beef.. that's the basic. why not in the menu?oil = uses too muchcarrots in the dough = not necessary onion in the dough = totally not necessary well, it almost tastes like okonomiyaki, but not quite. all those i bitched and commented, should be in the typical japanese cooking recipe book and really easy to figure out... so while i have no objections that non-japanese owns japanese restaurant.. please get the basics right, and at least try to provide a quality food.	0
came here for brunch and started to get my drink on first thing in the morning. their drinks are serious business. if i didn't have plans for later in the day, i would have found myself very happy by noon.	0
grabbed dinner there with my boyfriend. i was pretty excited bc i've walked by plenty of times and thought the space looked really cool. i guess i just felt underwhelmed about the experience. the bartender was a little less than friendly, although the cocktail was pretty good. we were seated in a table in a semi crowded area near the hostess stand. the menu seemed a little all over the place. i understand they were going for an upscale comfort food theme from the fried chicken and waffle and the meatloaf sandwich on the menu. i got the steak which seemed like a decent enough deal at $20 and my boyfriend got some kind of vietnamese sandwich. the steak portion was pretty skimpy, they kind of feathered it across the plate so it looks like more than it actually is. the sandwich my boyfriend got was cold and the bread was hard and stale. i'd save your money visit natt spil down the street for a better meal at about half the price.	1
slightly spicy curried flavored salad with cooked eggs	1
get to the chase:  pros: 1) have custards of the day 2) not mcd prices, but not manhattan-standard prices iether: $30ish dollars for 2 sodas, 1 hotdog, fries, 1 burger 3) they sell dog food too...wierd  cons: 1) wasn't impressed and still don't get why it's always packed. burgers and fries are no better than any other burger. nothing 2) the price isn't justified for what you get 3) their milklshakes are extreeemely heavy with just dollops of ice cream and artificial flavoring  order of the day: shake-cago hotodg, shack stack, fries, draught root beer, dr. pepper, shroom burger	0
i used to love this place.parking:valet parking for $3. service:i went around 1am on saturday...and the servers looked really out of it. bunch of guys working in the cashier. i ordered togo on the phone and went to pick it up...literally had to wait 20+ minutes even though it wasn't even that busy.food:why does the chicken not have any meat on it? i ordered 20pcs chicken wings... and all i remember eating was the fried skin.. is it even real chicken? lol.it's really disappointing because i love their seasoning. (soy + spicy) i'm a petit girl. i killed the wings and i was still hungry. :( their quality has gone down...	0
this place is adorable! the food is great- it is expensive but the view and the food is great.customer service is excellent.last night we went and waited in line. there were three people in front of us. as time went by more people added to the number of the people in front of us by the time we were almost close to getting in their number grow to 20. the girl at the door knew they were cutting in line and she sent them to the back of the line, that was the best feeling ever when she did that. :)the location is at the heart of downtown la there is a big parking lot in front of the building and they have valet so you won't have problem parking.	1
another place i pass on the way home from work everyday. i went on a wednesday afternoon and it just happened to be happy hour. awesome! they had delirium tremens for $6! i kinda wanted to give them 5 stars just for that. we ordered the six burger and it was great. anything i ever wanted in a burger. then i noticed a blonde looking curl in our fries. i didn't make a big fuss about it cuz i work at a restaurant and i understand that these things happen, but then i found 3 more. i asked the server and he checked with the kitchen staff. he came back and explained that it was string from the burlap sack that the potatoes came in. it made perfect sense. no one in the restaurant had blonde hair. i ate the rest of the meal and was very happy. the food was great, the server was on point, and the environment was comfortable and relaxing. it has a great community feel to it. the server took 25% of our burger because of the burlap strings. i told him he absolutely didn't have to but he insisted. i will definitely be coming back one of these sundays for brunch. they have endless mimosas and endless great white beer which is one of my faves.	1
gluten free everything (almost). it's so great to look at a menu and not be confined to just a few things on the menu. food was ready in 3ish minutes, came in a plastic tupperware tub, but tasted like white tablecloth sit down expensive food. i will be back!!	1
i've been waiting in anticipation for this restaurant to open since i live nearby. finally got to eat here and it was popping during lunch hour! not surprised though.. that's summerlin people and health nutty places for ya. each table has a tablet with their menu/ordering system on it and i like the concept, but it seemed a little unorganized. maybe because they just opened a few days ago? i ordered the daily detox juice and the shrimp superfood protein bowl -- yuuum! i'm already looking forward to my next visit because there are so many things i still want to try. perfect place to go to grab some healthy vegetarian-friendly eats.	1
cute! full on a friday night around 10, but the hostess was nice enough to split off a table from a double-table a couple was using only one side of and give it to us to sit down and eat. they really were good at utilizing the space, there were quite a few older couples who sat at tables for a good hour after they were done buying any service at all.  the poke was spicy, but awesome! it's a hawaiian raw-fish cube dish, served in a cup with and taro tacoand  shells for you to eat them in, i loved it. edamame was only $4, two appetizers and a beer were perfect for my bf and i while we killed time before a club!	1
def one of the better burgers in la, umami burger does what it names suggests and causes your mouth to water in the most delightful way due to the delectable tastes going into your mouth. i usually get the veggie sloppy or the ahi tuna burger because i am pescetarian but when i used to eat meat i liked the the hatch burger. in addition to all of the burgers which are each better than the next, they make some mean french and sweet potato fries. if you are in a really decadent mood get truffle everything. yum!they have a solid beer and cocktail collection too so this can be a good place to go with the boys for a burger and beer or a date with the lady as they have salads too ;). the decor fits the tone of the restaurant perfectly and the service is as you would want it to be: sharp, honest, experienced without being too comfortable. always a toss up between this and stout around the corner. have to try both if you have not.	1
i can see why this place has such mixed reviews; it is a lounge after all. the trick is to go early to avoid waiting in line. anytime you have to wait in line, score goes down automatically. as for us, we arrived at the restaurant around 8:45 for a dinner party, so the experience was quite astonishing.the elevators set the swanky and urbany tones. the restaurant itself is decent sized; it feels spacious because it's half open on the rooftop. i didn't get to top floor but we had out table set up out in the patio on the 1st floor of the restaurant. as everyone else has mentioned, amazing view and the ambiance! i especially love the retro couches/chairs and painted tiled floors. it sort of reminds me of edison where a flapper dress would've totally fit in.i was with a bday party of 13 so we sort of ordered and shared bites tapa-style, and mostly appetizers. - complimentary bread with butter and olive spread (5 stars). i'm not just giving it 5 stars because it's complimentary, haha... i loved how they were handed out individually by the server onto each one of our plates, and as many as you wish. the rolls were fresh, and the olive spread was a nice touch.- cheese dip (4 stars). this is a great sharing dish, perfect munchy food with drinks too! love the balsamic swirl on top of the cheese.- duck duck goose (3 stars). 3 finger sandwiches with smoked duck meat; i liked the flavor of the meat and the european lettuce, but the bread tasted stale. - porkbelly sliders (5 stars). deeeeeeeelish little smoked pork belly sliders with fried quail eggs on top! yum... the porkbelly was extremely aromatic, smoky and crispy (think extra-thick sliced bacon), not fatty at all! and how cute are these tiny little fried quail eggs, perfectly cooked with runny yokes. *note to self - steal the idea and add lil fried quail eggs to sliders at the next dinner party or potluck*- steamed mussels (3.5 stars). quite generous for appetizer portion and for the price. decent flavored broth, nothing amazing.- shake-n-bake frog drummies (3 stars). i was impressed with the originality and the presentation, but underwhelmed with the taste. tasted very bland, like under-seasoned chicken. - shredded rabbit (3 stars). this dish is a bit confusing. it comes with bread and kumquat puree on the side, like a spread. but when you fork into the meat, it just falls apart (not spread-able). there is no binding, instead in the texture of pull pork (without any sauce). interesting dish but forgettable.dishes on the other end of the table looked interesting too. the restaurant is definitely keen on presentations. overall this isn't a place you'd come to pig-out and expect a revolutionary culinary experience. but for the beautiful lounge atmospheres and superb service (both bartenders and wait staffs!), i'm very fond of this place. crowd: older, more mature yuppies.price: $$. (we expected to pay more, turned out reasonable. that's always a plus!)	1
first time i came here was with my cousin, and then they already got me hooked on their happy hour menu. then just yesterday me and my boyfriend came in and we found out happy hour is all day plus buy one get one free beer?! hell yeahhh! (: we ordered the: salmon carpaccio, korean kalbi, karage, calamari. i highly recommend all of them.  owner is nice, server was nice and atmosphere was pretty upbeat.  definitely worth the 30 min drive from my house even tho i have a korean bbq 5mins away.   my new favorite korean bbq	1
if you order a well drink like bourbon on the rocks. they charge you $2 for the rocks and $5 for the well drink. when the we'll drink is $5. but if you order buffalo trace on the rocks they charge you $15 for the drink but no $2 charge for the rocks? could someone explain this to me? (manager from herbs and rye) i'm confused that you would charge for rocks on one drink and not the other. this place will nickel and dime you for the drinks you order there.	0
this little shack in the wall, always have a line out the door and sometimes it's even down to the block. i think what everyone on line is here for is the enormous portions of roast pork that the owner chops up and puts into the small rice box. this place used to be only $2.75 for a small box of roast pork rice, now it's $3.50! i can go next door to get 3 items over rice.   to be honest the roast pork, although it is plentiful; it's very skinny and chopped thinly. the soy sauce is what makes the rice saucy. however for the couple who owns this place to go from a cart serving rice rolls to now their own hole in the wall, it's a great achievement and great step in this economy!	0
i got jamerica takeout and it was really messy but so worth it. the mango run chicken was enormous and everything i could have asked for. each element was flavorful and satisfying on their own but together they were magical.	0
everything's so delicious - not too heavy or greasy; the tastes are evenly balanced. my new favorite restaurant - i haven't had anything on the menu i didn't like. love the bibimbap!	1
wonderful customer service, delivered within given time and hot, great tasting pizza like new york pizza. only reason they didn't get a 5 star was simply because it was a little too greasy for my taste... after patting it down it was still delicious.	1
apparently reservations don't count for much here. we had a 7:15 pm dinner reservation. at about 6:30 pm, someone from the restaurant phoned me to say they were very backed up and we should come over at 7:40 or later. that has never happened to me before. when we got to the restaurant we found it filled with people heading to a key arena concert. we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. apparently the restaurant got greedy. people without reservations showed up for a pre concert dinner and they seated them, thus screwing over people with reservations.	0
my friends and i, in town for lollapalooza, were searching for a great place to celebrate my birthday. we found unite urban grille and were incredibly satisfied! i had the 8oz hanger steak cooked perfect to my liking (medium). as for my friend's dishes, they were all amazing! the unite burger - fantastically flavorful. everyone should definitely try the shrimp skewers (side dish or full entree). the mango salsa on the shrimp had the perfect sweet kick. another friend had the salmon, which he enjoyed. and as for the desserts - wonderful! we had the peanut butter mousse cake (gluten- free) and lemon layer cake. both were great! i would definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for terrific food in a chill environment.	1
strike 2, david bracha...chef, this is the second time i am unpleasantly surprised, after highly recommending your restaurant.   i have always been a huge fan of river oyster bar- naming it one of the most underrated restaurants in miami.. i even believed rob was better than the chef's newer restaurant, oak tavern in the design district. thus, i recommended this restaurant for my friend's birthday yesterday.   in the past, my biggest issue with this restaurant has been that when you order the whole fish, the wait staff plainly refuses to de-bone the fish for you. i thought it was unacceptable even in my early foodie days... that being said, i chose not to order the whole fish, and ordered the following... ceviche, burrata, pork belly flatbread, and one stone crab claw (not even select size costing 23$). now, before we get to the rest of it, let me fill you in. last week i dined at joe's stone crab, where i ordered an entire pound (5 select claws) for 58 bucks. you don't have to be an accountant to know i was being slammed with a 23$ single claw that didn't even come to the table cracked. i sent back the claw because i struggled at the table for 15 minutes, only to find that nothing was coming out. the waitress argued with me before taking the claw back to be cracked, and then proceeded to bring it back, uncracked!! yes, i still paid for the full amount of the claw, and yes the meat remained in the uncracked claw.   moreover.... i wasn't able to finish the ceviche or the burrata.. why? you may ask? oh because our plates were removed from the table without even asking, and the half eaten burrata was cleared from the table without my asking, even though i had specifically asked that the burrata accompany the flatbread as my main dish. i guess my issue is not so much with the actual kitchen as it is with the service. of course, we gave 20% tip, but diners, be advised. you don't get the 3 or even 4 star dining experience, overall. what you get is good food and that's it, unfortunately.	0
i went to cole's two times and every time i had bad experience. first of all food was not that good and tasting stale. i thought it might be the one time thing but when i went second time, it was even worst. i complained about the food to the waiter and he didnt show the courtesy to offer me the replacement. plus when i checked my cc bills after a month, i noticed that they charged me more than they suppose to. compare to philippe, cole's is way better in food quality and service. i think everyone should try cole's french dip once in their life.	0
i'll say, before offering up my review, that i am not typically a review-writer. we do however, live in a world in which people will often tell you--in no uncertain terms--if you are doing something wrong, so i would be remiss if i didn't tip my hat to perch for getting a few things right.  they've created an environment geared toward and professional relaxationand . i'd leave the kiddies at home for a jaunt down to perch. i've been there several times and the crowd seems to be the young(ish), sexy and sophisticated business professional crowd of downtown la looking for a place to unwind. a chat with the bartender manager revealed an easy-to-talk-to woman keen on her history of the drinks she was serving, when asked about them. (a good bartender usually ensures their tip in some similar manner.) she was kind enough to offer us a free round as well. (after spending about $120 bucks, i appreciated the show of customer loyalty.) it's not the cheapest place but you'll get a solid bang for your buck with the ambiance that's created by the well-mannered servers and recently updated decor. it can bit a wee bit chilly atop the high-rise following sunset, so bring a jacket if you plan to spend an evening up there; but the sunsets themselves...very sexy and worth the trip. it makes a good and dateand  spot. guys, if there's any interest from the lady, she'll have to throw you a smooch (or two) after going here.  do yourself a favor and check out perch on a thursday or friday evening. you won't be disappointed. oh...and don't forget to rock.	1
btw - there's a carl's jr. pastrami burger commercial running right now that's shot inside of canter's...and there is no way that burger could even come close to competing... sorry carl's' jr.	1
i've been back several times for breakfast and lunch (hard to stay away from a $5 breakfast here!). i think breakfast might be the best meal. lots of choices, and everything we've had was well done. generous french press coffee service. the seafood gumbo at lunch was not my favorite, and im not sure why, except i didn't like the taste much. it was dark, but very thin, and not the taste i remember from new orleans (or mine). my favorite lunch so far was foie gras on savory pain perdu. i knew it wouldn't be a giant portion, but i had to order it to get it off my mind. it was probably barely 2x3 inches, but so much flavor in those few bites! i also shared some haricots verts with bacon, slightly undercooked (there is a difference between al dente and undercooked). the amazing thing was that i was satisfied for many hours until dinner. there are reasons to enjoy fat!	0
as with some of the readers, i have been to japan as well and have their food in its native environment. however, the food here was a bit disappointing. the only reason they received 4 stars instead of 3 was because of how fast the food came out. i ordered the sashimi, sushi and chicken teriayaki bento and my girlfriend ordered the unagi don. we also had two extra orders of salmon and tuna nigiri. first, the salmon and tuna just did not have that fresh taste to it. i believe there was bits of ice on the fish as well. the rice attached to it fell apart right away and made it a bit hard to eat. i always use my hands to eat nigiri because sushi was first made outside of japanese theatre's as a sort of finger food. how awesome huh? movie theatre nachos aint got s#!t on sushi (:  anyways our main courses arrived right after and the teriyaki was pretty mediocre. i didn't like how some of the chicken was burnt and had this bitter taste to it that couldn't even be masked by the teriyaki sauce. i liked how they had accompanying sushi and sashimi however they had the same problems as the aforementioned appetizers.  my girlfriend ordered the unagi don which is basically eel with this sweet teriyaki-like sauce over rice. very simple and when i had it in japan the eel was tender and the sauce was well flavored. it was pretty good here too except the eel was a bit tough in some places and almost a bit dried out in the center, which i don't really like. i like my unagi don soft and saucy and eaten with lots of rice (:  all in all the experience was okay, they served green tea ice cream at the end which my girlfriend and i don't eat and the service was pretty good and the wait for food was pretty short. i think next time i'd like to try other places within little tokyo.	1
if you like roast beef sandwiches, eating outside, fast food which isn't overly processed/plastic, nostalgic decor, cleanliness, and fast service, this spot is for you! amazing sammy's, relatively cheap, quick service, and friendly staff are all what you'll encounter. eat inside the small spot, or outside in the covered patio. it's not fancy or gastro-pub...so don't judge it like that. but it's great in it's own context.	1
thought i was sitting down at a simple but solid diner. found out otherwise. the food was fine, but the coffee and tea were horrendous; the prices were high, and the service was mediocre. this place is a cheap diner with posh restaurant prices. look elsewhere on union, or better yet, leave the neighborhood.	0
we got the special, cauliflower-garlic-olive oil-smoked mozzarella. ..absolutely fabulous. second pizza was the fennel sausage and was also stunning. great service, great vibe. good way to end our last evening in seattle!	1
i'm always a fan of businesses active and on top of their yelp / social media. luna park is one of those. the owner peter came up to us and we talked about their yelp deal! especially in la, its always a great feeling to learn that the owner really does care about your experience in their restaurant. this is a rare quality. if it's your first time, you must try the mussels and frites and the el camerone pizza. they have a really outstanding happy hour 2 for 1 appetizers and drinks till 7pm on weekdays. you can't beat that! i need to try dessert next time!!!	1
the owner of this annapolis favorite, paul meyer,  continues to provide a wonderful experience and fine food.  i had not been in a while but once again, excellent by every measure.	0
moving and packing sucks especially when it's some of your best friends leaving for the burbs. helping them get ready for their move into the land of strip malls, we got hungry. for lunch, we went to birchwood kitchen and got takeout. judging by the takeout line, i knew this place had to be good. our friend enlightened me on the best sandwiches to try here. i followed his lead and ordered a grilled gruyere with ham. while waiting in line, he gushed about how awesome the cookies were. so, we got one for everyone who helped pack minus their toddler.   oh that first bite of the sandwich was heavenly. birchwood kitchen's grilled gruyere sandwich is the grownup version of grilled cheese. they packed the sandwich with ham and cheese with a delicious spread of djion mustard to compliment the cheeses. wow, that sandwich totally made my day. the chocolate chip cookie lived up to the hype of being one of the best chocolate chip cookies. it reminded me of the warm, gooey ones mom makes right out of the oven. the sandwich and the cookie were so good that i would go out of my way just to have that meal again.	1
tried brisket and beef rib. huge rib. good but the brisket was way better. try that! not a fan of the beans and potato salad. mac and cheese was pretty good though!	0
after hearing stellar reviews about this restaurant as one of the top steakhouse in vegas, my friend jordan and i decided to check this place out. it is located inside the d, downtown.  the restaurant itself have a very nice atmosphere. we were sat in a tall, private, circular booth that would be ideal for a romantic date night. our server was very attentive and helped assist in pairing a nice glass of red wine to our steak.   for our appetizer, we had the beet salad (very sweet with yellow and red beets accompanied with a mayo drizzle) and the lobster risotto (not a fan- was bland and missing wine!). our steak was cooked perfectly to order and seasoned nicely. our server wheeled out the a tall tier of dessert after our main course and we were able to pick and choose instead of looking at a menu.  dessert was a light, flavorful, and decadent coconut cake with coconut shreds, whipped cream and whatever else i can't remember... it was heavenly and my favorite part of dinner.  overall this is a decent steakhouse(my favorite steakhouse will always be cut) and very reasonably priced for the service that you receive our total bill came out to about $140 before tip for 2 glasses of wine, 2 appetizer, steak main course and dessert.	1
i wish i could place the photo for reference here but i did add the photo to the collection. i was excited to try the perch for the first time last night. i ordered their $20 egg salad with steak and ask for it to go. my destination was right in the park so this wasn't due to travel time but when i opened up my salad, i was extremely disappointed. the bread crostini were so hard i couldn't even eat them, literally could not even bite into it. the poached egg was still half raw and yolkless, couldn't eat it that either. the steak was really rare and looked like it had been squeezed together. the salad itself was seriously maybe 6 bites worth that included some bacon pieces, possibly less than 2oz of steak. this was not a refined $20 salad i was expecting, it was a $4 dollar salad at best. i will not be trying there food again because the lack of passion for the food clearly shows. restaurants should be proud of the food they are putting out, even if it is to go.	0
so, they may as well have played glory days when i walked in here for dinner the other night. i have very fond memories of this place from when i was in my early 20s and used to visit friends that went to school here. maybe i was one of those annoying people that yelpers are complaining about being drunk and obnoxious.	0
meatball heaven! i love meatballs so once my boyfriend found this little gem we knew it was a must try. we ordered the grinder with pork meatballs and pesto sauce and ballacart balls with mushroom gravy and also cheddar cheese sauce. beer selection is huge! we tried about 5 different beers. highly suggest trying a strawberry beer. service was awesome and rapid. can't wait to come back and try more.	1
the watermelon lemonade is freaking brilliant....so was pork sandwich and mac and cheese cupcake.  i'll be back this weekend...or tonight. :)	1
loved this place! the food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere had its cool going on, creative, unique and cozy. the staff was just lovely. definitely pay a visit, it will quickly become a favorite.	1
i've eaten here several times and have tried a couple of different dishes. honestly, i only give it two stars because i always receive exceptional service here. from the menu, the only thing that i'd recommend with confidence is the chicken meatballs appetizer. the rest of the food is hit or miss depending on who is in the kitchen. i don't expect much here either, but the food is just inedible at times.  oh yeah, soup and salad deal isn't bad at all, but i can't really up any stars for that. 2 is generous enough	0
garlic noodles with five spice chicken!!??!!  my hopes were really high for this place... but when the food came out, i looked at it and sniffed it........... where the fuck is the garlic smell???? the texture of the noodles were good but i barely tasted any garlic.. it was bland and it sucked.five spice chicken? i liked the skin it was really crispy!imperial rolls?? it was a joke that shit was stale and had a foul smell when i bit into it.fish sauce was also very bland. i don't get how this place got such a high rating, but i'm pretty sure its because you can't get garlic noodles w/ five spice chicken anywhere else..	0
im confused here.the cherry tomatoes on this november filetti pizza were very oddly bitter. we said as much to the waitress. there was exactly one bite taken from this pizza, her response was "do you want to take this pizza home?" odd again. after we said no, she tossed it. yet we were charged for it. reason being, this is how the pizza usually is. no it's not, i would never return for bitter tasting food. i was really hurt, that they have a no complaint policy here. what is this, the pizza lottery? either you get a winner or you don't at your cost? i'm so upset, i don't want this culture of food to exist anywhere, can't believe it's operating right here, this whole time at one of my favorite places... i'm really sad here : (	0
very very bland food, i really wanted to love this place, and i was very disappointed	0
my mum and i decided to go here for lunch today since we were in the mood for sino-korean food and she wanted to check it out since she read that they had recently renovated. they offer valet parking in the back, but we opted for free street parking instead.  we walked in to find a family waiting at the front desk, with no employees in sight. they were waiting to pay for their food and leave, so i thought they must be in a hurry. but no one was coming to help them... or to seat us! i did see servers walking around, but they just looked at us blankly and ignored us. finally after several minutes of waiting one of them came to seat us. i was already feeling a bit critical on being ignored upon entering, so my opinion of this place just went even lower when they handed us torn menus that were taped together. mine didn't even have a cover on it. this place is advertising that they're newly remodeled and yet they're giving customers crappy torn menus?! not cool.  i will say that the venue looked pretty nice. they have a wall of large rooms which apparently can open into one really huge banquet hall. the main dining area has a large tv, which was playing the lakers game. and their bathroom is clean (two stalls) but smelled really strongly of bleach.  the food did make me feel a little better about this place. for side dishes, they give you kimchi (mum said it was just ok), kkakdugi (this was pretty good), raw onions, and danmoogi (yellow picked radish). i ordered a small jjajangmyun and my mum ordered a small jjampong; we also ordered spicy garlic shrimp to share. i appreciate that they offer small portions of their noodles, since my mum and i wanted completely different items. the jjajangmyun was pretty decent, and my mum thought the same of the jjampong. neither of us were a fan, however, of the spicy garlic shrimp. it wasn't bad, per say, it just wasn't very good. a bit disappointing.  service was also pretty slow. i had to flag someone down whenever i wanted anything, and i never did get a refill on my water :( overall, the food here is decent, but why bother coming back when the food is better at young king across the street and the service is much better?!	0
generous portions.  reasonably priced.  friendly and responsive service.  excellent food.	1
came here and had a late lunch. i ordered the wedge salad with soup for $12.50 it was definitely nothing spectacular a wedge of lettuce sprinkled with salad dressing and bacon bits far from spectacular. i also had the ahi tuna for the amount you get and the price tag it was not worth it.	0
i'm pretty generous with stars actually. so i would've given this place 5 if only their chicken was not so dry.i came for dinner and ordered under their "house specials" the kai yang dinner (which is basically their thai bbq chicken but with the shrimp fried rice). their thai bbq chicken is one of their famous plate.their decor look outdated, old-school. service was fair.i first came here few years ago and remembered it being good enough to come back. so i came for dinner on a friday night around 7:30pm. there wasn't a long line, which i expected, but glad there wasn't. so we were seated within 5 minutes.the chicken had a nice charred flavored skin, their famous honey bbq dip, and their delicious shrimp fried rice. even their two pieces of fried shrimp was tasty with a subtle crunch. i mixed my fried rice with their chili and jalepeno juice sauce(yum). it was overall very good, except their very dry chicken. but for me, all the other good flavors made up for it.my bf's pad see ew was more disappointing. first off, once arriving to your table the visual appeal of the food was not enticing. it was just an all brown mush of noodles with the green colors of broccoli. but who cares as long as it tastes good right? it was ok. kind of sticky on eachother and after shoving the same brown noodle, you will get sick of finishing it.but i still like their bbq chicken and will be back a few years later.	1
the two stars are for the view. everything else was average. the food at the restaurant was pricey but yet bland. the rooftop bar didn't have enough sitting area, although they done good beers.	0
the side of fries were yummy and accompanied my drink well...i don't remember much else.	1
the barrymore seemed like a vegas boutique hotel just a short cab ride away from our hotel on the strip. the food was excellent and offered a nice balance of selections for traditional and experimental eaters. and our one sister had many choices for gluten free eating. those who had steaks said they were among the best.  same for the fish. sides were shared and provided a fantastic array of dining pleasures.   it was the service, though, that made the evening. i felt like i was on a 5 star cruise ship. or maybe it was the half priced wine at happy hour that enhanced the evening! lovely experience all around. thanks. sorry if we were too rowdy.	1
always great!!! amazing food and amazing people! check out the bacon cheese burger!	1
i'm not sure how this place got such great reviews. i've eaten at many korean places and this place was by far the worst food, if not the worst dinner, i have ever eaten.   the broth was completely watered down, the tea was just hot water, and the meat was fatty and dry.   the kimchi and raddish were good but it's hard to mess that up.	0
this place is fun! once you walk in the ambiance is like you just walked into a latin themed disney world. delicious food, the bandeja paisa is my recommendation hands down! start off with a few colombian empanadas, and wash it down with un refajo (its a concoction of half colombian beer and half colombian soda, works as a great hangover recipe too!)	1
super fresh and delicious.3 staple soups and 3 chef specials that are different everyday. toasty, crusty bread to dip in the soup...the tomato basil soup and a grilled cheese is just a super classic, but always ask the chef what's new, she always has some great stuff working. very friendly place. she made a shrimp bisque one time and it was on point. definitely made my day, such a great spot.....lacks one star for the parking...other wise food and service are great.	1
this was the worst service i've had in a long time. can you guess how long it took for someone to come by to take our drink orders after we sat down? just take a wild guess.a friend of mine guessed 10 minutes. ha! i wish!we waited .... 50 minutes. that's right. nearly an entire hour. we finally got a waitress after we asked two separate employees if someone was serving our table. the waitress commented that it was because our waiter james was on a break. funny, because i know which one is james and he had been helping the table next to us during the past hour. needless to say, i am never coming back here. i would tell you what i thought about the food, but honestly it doesn't even matter after service like this.	0
i am addicted to ramen, and takara's miso ramen is probably my favorite ramen ever. the broth is the best i've had-- super rich, and oh-so-flavorful. the noodles, garnishes, etc. are all well and good. pretty expensive, but i know, its hollywood price and it'll be offset with the quality of the ramen.  will come back for sure:)	1
after a previous review, we went back for sunday brunch. i had the crab benedict and my husband had the salmon benedict. both were delicious.it was a beautiful day, so it was a perfect spot! i am glad we went back and had a meal instead of just beers and a snack. the place is a little pricey, don't expect to go there and spend less than $50 for 2 people sans alcohol.	1
nothing compared to yakitori totto! we came to this place after having a great experience in yakitori totto and seeing all the good reviews about taisho, but we were dead wrong. we were seated in the little sketchy room in the very back of the restaurant. the skewers came burnt and didn't even taste close to totto's. never coming back.	0
this place was awful. my boyfriend and i went here for a late dinner. we received our appetizer and salad and everything was cool. my boyfriend got his meal and i didn't. i figured mine would be out shortly. 20 minutes later, my boyfriend asked the waiter where my meal was. the waiter half ass apologizes to me for "forgetting" to put my order in and that he would put it in and it would be out quickly. another 20 minutes later i receive my meal. it was literally a charred burger on a stale bun with a piece of cheese on top. i was so upset that i asked for the bill. i just wanted to leave. the waiter never returned. we could've just walked out. we walked up to the register and after waiting another 15 minutes we were finally able to leave. i was in a bad mood all night because of the shitty service. horrible. horrible. horrible. i can't say it enough.	0
we truly enjoyed stripers. before our reservation we ordered a glass of wine and sat in the adirondacks on the lawn looking out to the ocean. we saw the sun set and the moon rise. the wine was extremely good. the ambience is so relaxing but far from casual everyday. it was special. the food very good. our waiter a delight.	1
we got the opportunity to experience aj bombers yesterday. to start off the service was fantastic it looked as if there was one person working the bar and dining area but since it was not overly busy he did a fantastic job keeping us all happy and making suggestions off the menu if we asked as well as suggestions on different beers etc. our kids loved the fact that they could draw all over the chalkboard it kept them occupied while we waited for our food which is awesome gave my hubby and i the opportunity to actually talk which is rare with 3 monsters also my kids got a kick out of the fact that they could throw peanut shells on the floor they just could not believe it when i told them so i had to actually get up and show them that it is ok here but not at home! the big bummer was the actual planes that bring the peanuts to your table were broken :( and my kids really wanted to see that! ok on to the food. we had a bloody mary which was ok i mean yeah it was good but i was not jumping for joy over it. it had quite a few little snacks in it as well. i ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls to start and my hubby ordered the cheese curds. the buffalo chicken egg rolls were super yummy they were pretty much buffalo chicken wrapped in an egg roll the chicken was not overly spicy just the perfect amount of spice for me. i never tried the cheese curds but my husband seemed to enjoy them and so did our 3 year old. on to the burgers which for me sadly was somewhat of a disappointment. i am a burger lover seriously who does not enjoy a good burger?!?!? so i ordered the mad sconnie burger i was expecting a monster for $8.75 for the burger alone and when it was brought to my table i was like seriously this is it!?! it was small not what i was expecting. the flavor was ok but nothing i would get overly excited about. my husband ordered the bomber burger which was the messiest and i tried it was ok but like mine i was not overly impressed. so all in all it was a disappointing visit considering i was looking forward to indulging in a magnificent burger and had a mediocre one instead and not to mention i think they are pricey for what you get which is not much :( i don't foresee us going back unfortunately.	1
who doesn't love pie? pie and a pint, or a pietini, as they serve here.	0
great place to lounge day or night.try the burger, its among the best in la.	1
claims to be healthy even says they want to help you make healthy choices. yet they serve soy products, agave and raw kale. i can understand some people wanting to be vegetarian but at least make the right choices and don't spread false information and food that are part of the problems of why people are sick.	0
never order any curry dishes. perhaps it's my fault for ordering curry at a noodle house but the tiny sliver of katsu (pork) on my curry was offensively tiny for $11. about 3 bites worth.	0
i'm so happy there's a good indian restaurant in los feliz now. went here a few nights ago and had a great meal. their hottest level of spice is pretty hot, but if you're used to the blandness of the other indian spot on vermont, you're in for a nice surprise with this place -- lots of flavor, even when it's hot. great selection of veggie stuff and the staff is super nice. i really hope people keep going here and it sticks around.	1
food was great. management or whoever takes down reservations sucked. if they lose your reservation, you will be seated in front of a cold door. i hope all gratuity that was included on the bill goes to waiting staff and kitchen. while the food was really good, i wont ever go back... nyc has many other great chicken spots.	0
i am neither from south nor have southern food before, besides i love fried chicken and chicken wings just like everyone else. i found pies-and-thighs yesterday, and i realized the taco place next door has been closed already. not sure the story behind the name of restaurant but it caught my attention. i came for breakfast today, it's very southern and country breakfast diner style. you can see the preparation of your food, it's behind the counter. they have nice little wooden table and booth just enough for per person. the menu is mostly as usual such as egg, sandwich, salad and fried chicken. also i love their pecans butter donut, peanuts on the top and the donut doesn't seem too sweet which is good, because a lot places make their donut bit sweet. the banjo with sausage was delicious, sausage is very different, i can tell it might be fresh made by themselves. interesting to know and i loved it. it's a good place to go for breakfast and brunch.	1
i got a little tipsy after my visit to fornino. thats a good thing!  i don't particularly love thin crusted pizza, but i like what they do here.  their funghi misti pizza is sooo good. its drizzled with white truffle oil and covered with mozzarella and a whole bunch of other kinds of mushrooms.  i also tried one with a sausage i think its the salsiccia di pollo, it was very tasty. i love the cheese they use.  portions are a bit small, but its totally worth it since you also get to enjoy an unbeatable front row view looking out into lower manhattan and statue of liberty.  people should come here!	1
oy. dining, especially at the and gastrobarand  end of the spectrum, isn't generally meant to be an exercise and humiliation and condescension. but egregiously titled j'eatjet (say it out out loud, but in french) is doing to their best to bring this new attitude to the neighborhood.  i went last night around dusk and had to wander around the restaurant and the patio to find a server. she allowed me to sit on a two-top outside, right next to a water filling station. here large jugs of tap water are put in a plastic container before being slowly pour into long, skinny wine bottles. very complicated and time consuming, while not being additive in the slightest.   when my waitress and wine bottle arrived, i was told that the restaurant didn't have printed menus yet, but instead only had food written on a chalkboard. as it was now almost dark and the wooden patio is only lit with faux-vintage thick filament bulbs, the board was impossible to read from my table.   so i ordered and a beer asked what was on the menu. my waitress paused, looked confused and disappeared.  ten minutes passed. a man in a striped shirt, obviously the manager, comes over and says: and i hear you have some questions about the menu,and  with the tone of 'i hear you are an asshole.'  yes, i said, what's available?  and well the menu is clear on the chalkboard inside.and   and should i go in there and look at it? what do you have?and   then he started to list out the items, but only one or two. we have a burger, he said, and lamb belly. i went to order the lamb belly, which he said was an appetizer portion. he then would say a couple more dishes, but wouldn't say if they were main courses or appetizers. i just wanted to order!  eventually, i got the pretzel bites for an appetizer and a burger. i believe they also have pickled fried chicken, but no other entrees were told to me. still no beer. my beer didn't come until another 15 minutes later, after two promises and a reorder. this beer was not comped, nor was there an apology offered for the mix-up. the pretzel bites came with a beer cheese that far outnumbered the pretzels and lacked bite. the burger served on attractive ring of wood, came with just a piece of lettuce garnish and some barbecue sauce, but no sides. that's fine, but it wasn't made clear when i ordered.  j'eatjet is a new restaurant and there are bound to be kinks. just don't take them out on your customers.	0
longest wait for two tortas and one taco. we ended up waiting for 40min. not to mention our waiter forgot to serve our drinks and mess up on one of our tortas. one of the chefs did come out and asked us for our feedback he took our criticism well, but i do feel he should of done something more. worst experience and service ever. sorry guys, will not be coming here again.	0
this place is super yummy. just be ready for the crowds and the typical la scene. it does take a bit to sit down and parking can be a pain, so just valet. if its a super sunny day you should sit outside.they have a good menu - variety is key. we had the chicken chow salad and also some french toast and it was both so fresh and good!	1
nothing special at all! must be more granola eating wierdos with low standards who gave this place a positive review- i don't understand- my cappacino was good though-	0
i've had a few of the panini's (lemoni supremo , mediterraneo , italiano) as well as the turkey wrap and they have all been wonderful. the smoothies are fresh and refreshing. the staff is friendly. i will be returning.	1
love this place! their fish tacos are delicious.   plus they do a great happy hour later in the day (i think it goes from about 4-7) shrimp and fish is always fresh and when you add avocado it's perfection.   their shrimp tacos are fantastic! i go here all the time and have never been disappointed.  i just wish they were open a little later!	1
ordered a pick-up order of sausage and peppers sandwich for lunch and what i got was best described as a soupy mess. my co-workers meals all looked good. at least they included someone else's meal with ours so i had something to eat. i may try this place again sometime, but definitely not ordering that again.   (i posted a photo of the and sandwichand )	0
the best coffee in seattle!!!!! el diablo has the best cafe con leche ever... well lets just say i have never found it any other place and there isn't anything like it.... totally amazing!	1
the ambiance in this night spot is turn't up. beautiful ladies abound and i'm sure the women feel the same about the fellas. it's a very nice crowd here and the food is very good. the seared ahi tuna is wonderful and light tasting (melt in your mouth type good). we also tried the buffalo frog legs and they were excellent. the view is gorgeous.	1
love this place. the coffee is great, the bagels are amazing! i tried their bacon breakfast wrap this morning and that was great too.  my girlfriend always orders iced coffee, and this is the only place to use ice cubes made of coffee! its great, your coffee is never watered down.	1
thank you sabrina for intriducing me to such a great sushi place!  this name literally describes the place. there is only a sushi bar to sit so have patience here. there is also 1 guy making the rolls so you need even more patience. so if you are lookign for a fast lunch during your break, this might not be the place for you. if you are a sushi lover and have all the time in the world, then please visit this place!  you can pick and choose your rolls from 2 different places. there is a menu you can look through that includes their simplier rolls and there is also a few dry erase boards with more rolls.  so far i hae tried the alex #2 roll and the ninja roll and they are both mmm! i like how they incorporate non-traditional items in the rolls like guava, mango, etc.	1
i've been using yelp for years and this is the first time that i've decided to actually join and leave a review.   i will make my review very short and concise: amazing food and excellent service.   customer service that goes above and beyond your expectations.   we had the opportunity to share our experience with chef james; he took the time to stop by our table a couple of times to explain the plates and checked on us. he also took the time to share a couple of other plates (that were not on the menu) to provide us with an unforgettable experience.   this is a must do from now on.	1
roy choi never disappoints man. tried his latest restaurant with a large group of friends and family styled the meal. everything was so tasty and fun! the aprons add a cute touch to the meal. and i like the cubby holes that hold the utensils for dinner.   there were 6 of us and we ordered the bbq spicy pork (my favorite!!), kimchi fried rice, kush, grilled squid, noodle of the day, poke me, and a large boot knocker to share. this was more than enough food for our party. we left feeling very full and satisfied. every dish we ordered was great and had choi's typical burse-ment of flavor with each bite. the man is gifted. the only thing i wasn't too obsessed with that we ordered would be the boot knocker. it definitely tasted and looked like something someone who had been smoking pot would throw together and cook haha. it was instant noodle with spam, sausages, and other canned meats. the broth was veryy spicy.. and that's the only taste i can remember about it. the soup was all sorts of random and didn't taste that exciting. but other than that, everything else was amazing and i can't wait to come back and eat here! loved the atmosphere and the food!	1
when toast first opened, there was a rumor among us nyc ex-pats that it was being run by the same delicious hands that brought us our beloved magnolia bakery. that this was ever true seems more and more dubious a claim. true, there are cupcakes to be bought that *look* a lot like magnolia's, but a single bite tells you these are either magnolia's 2-day-old leftovers, that much worse for the wear of shipping, or just crap la imitations.   beside the disappointing cupcakes, there's a whole dining experience just waiting to bum you out. from the throngs of clueless hipster clones driving wait times into the stratosphere, to the often rude service, to the overpriced diner food that will, eventually, reach your table.   save yourself the time and frustration. the long line here is in no way an indication of desirability.	0
the locro and lomo saltado were so savory and delicious, i couldn't believe i had to get off cloud 9 and go back to work. with the expected perfect la weather, we sat on the balcony and took in this piquant decadence with a healthy dose of all the weirdness hollywood has to offer. the service was good but we were also pretty much the only ones there. i can't wait to come back for evening drinks to experience the remodeled interior (which is gorgeous). the tamarind and smoke is calling my name.	1
there's nothing to complain about at carmine's. bring your friends and a big appetite. everything was fantastic and the 7 of us had enough food left for another meal. can't wait for next years visit	1
always great service , honestly i don't mind waiting for my food. cause the chicken fries are just too bomb !!	1
this place is great.  i have seen colombian food on some of those travel channel shows. my mom would talk about certain meals when i was a kid. both would talk about how huge the meals were. yup, they were right.  i have had only two items here. reason, both items are outstanding and i just can't get away from ordering my favorites. the sancocho de res con arroz is delicious. bandeja paisa arroz, frijoles, maduro, huevo, arepa y chicharron also fantastic.  check out their website <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fsanpocho.com%2fmenu.htmlands=38789557282be484ff2e3640918956ab9f8f9f58d8acc26949966fe7dda43941" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sanpocho.com/menu.html</a> they describe the food through an interactive menu. great job.  both dishes were huge, tasty and great value. this is not fine dining, but if you want a good meal to start of your day or satisfy your hunger pains during the day, come on down.  service is simple and fast. no frills just good food and a smile.	1
the 2 smallest, sweetest sandwiches (banana, strawberry) were the best here, as i wasn't as blown away by the 2 savory grilled cheeses (classic, crispy goat) i ordered for nothing oop after the amazon local voucher. after letting me know that i understandably couldn't stack the yelp checkin special for a free drink with the amazon local offer, the very personable guy running the show offered to bring a water, but later decided he'd offer the checkin special (though brought a sprite, not coke, odd). skipped the late-running (12-5) lunch special (though it may not have been stackable anyway).  i was going to categorize things as those classing up the joint vs. those not, but that's not what grilled cheeseries are about, so... pluses: balthazar bread olives (jar likely tossed out mistakenly by many, should go disposable) cheese/cutting board awesome restroom great tunes overhead prices seem on par with melt shop  minuses: the consistency of the cheese on the classic and the crispy goat the flavor of the classic -- could barely justify 4 stars given that they didn't really nail the benchmark wax paper over aforementioned cheese/cutting board (judging by the top of the trash, they still need to wash them between uses) aforementioned music was too louid for 4:30pm, though it still couldn't drown out the owner/manager (?) on a heated call with someone claiming to be coned stating they owned money, which frankly sounded like an extortion scam (if it wasn't, hope they're doing ok and they were lucky no other customers arrived)	1
maybe i caught them on an off day (it was 9:30 on a monday morning), but it was pretty so so. i got the eggs and potato fritata thing and it was thoroughly uninspiring. salad bar looked good but haven't had a chance to try it.	0
i was in the mood for good sushi and decided to take my sister with me to little tokyo. it was my first time at oomasa so i checked out what my fellow yelpers have been yelping about. saturday afternoon we waited for about ten minutes until we got seated on the counter. the restaurant was busy enough without service being affected. what to expect? as soon as you get inside the restaurant, you need to take a number [as opposed to writing your name on their waiting list ] and stand in line until one of the servers escort you to your seat. they will ask if you prefer the booth or the counter. at this point, since we didn't want to wait longer than 10 minutes [and we were starving] we decided to seat at the counter. the good stuff - food and prices! -spicy yellow tail roll spicy flavored yellow tail (4 pcs) $5 -spider roll soft shell crab, cucumber and sprout (4 pcs) $10 -rainbow roll tuna, yellowtail, halibut, salmon, eel and shrimp over california roll (6 pcs) $12 -sashimi lunch 3 kinds of fresh seafood. (served with soup, steamed rice, and japanese pickles) (9 pcs) 16.00 everything we had was absolutely fantastic! the fish was fresh and it had really good flavors..making my tummy very happy. what you need to know? -great sushi, sashimi and rolls selection at affordable price-great for take out -oomasa validates 2 hours free parking	1
this happen when the restaurant change the chef... the beginning was good, now horrible, just wasted money to garbage. please find someone can cook asian food, come on you open hibachi which is asian food, so make sure they understand the taste of asian food. you have good location.	0
great sushi great service pricey but i guess you have to pay for qualty sushi. i had the godzila roll and the samon sunrise both were awsome. two big hands on the belly.	1
if i can rate with 0 star i would totally do that. this place took 2 hours and 15 mins for take out orders that's only 7 miles away!! and i placed my order at 3:30pm on a friday! madness!!	0
i didn't feel slim or healthy after having lunch here but i must say i was pleasantly surprised by the food! we came here for lunch today and the restaurant was actually packed. my co-worker and i decided to share combo 1, which comes with the seafood pesto pasta, half and half pizza, and 2 drinks. it came out to exactly $26.02 after tax, which is not bad at all. i also tried a bit of my other coworker's kimchi and fish roe pasta. everything was tasty and a good portion! we actually had a lot of leftovers too. i like the concept of it being "healthy" because they don't use msg, sugar, or butter, etc. but since it's pasta and pizza, it was still pretty heavy! they do, however, use whole wheat pasta and wheat tortilla for the pizza crust (and they also have salads). next time i want to try their pumpkin soup, served in an actual pumpkin! there's a parking lot next to it with 90 minute free with validation or you can always find street/meter parking.	1
yay!! i walk by this place all the time and from the sidewalk, at least at night, it looks so cute inside. they must do wonders with the lighting because i went on a sunday afternoon and the decor was just ok. i'm not going to subtract points for that though because every dish we ordered was fab! it was happy hour and i'll have to admit that the specials were not that great. the white wine was $7 a glass instead of the usual $8. really? what kind of special is that? oh well, i went with it anyway. the wine was a soave that was perfectly fine. we first ordered the spicy burrata with sun-dried tomatoes and arugula. now i'm not sure what is rolled up in the middle of this but it was amazing!! a nice size ball of burrata with a very spicy center, plop a slice of that on a toast round with some tomatoes and arugula and pure heaven. next up were the falafel buns. these were basically sliders in those lovely chinese buns. the sauce and spices were just right and i could have eaten many more of these. our last plate was the brussels sprouts with bleu cheese and figs and this was pure sweet decadence. we weren't starving and although the portions are on the smaller side, i know this is a tapas type place but that range can be huge, we were satisfied with what we ordered. this will definitely be a neighborhood spot i will visit again and again.	1
decent food. bad service. sat outside and a cockroach fell on my menu. minus points for no discount.  to address the comment: dear sir, i wish my drinks had arrived as quickly as your comment. i too am a miami native and this is the first time a and palmetto bugand  has ever fallen onto my dinner table. we couldn't be seated inside bc there was not enough room, so we were told that someone would come out with a flashlight, which never happened. then the and palmetto bugand  climbed onto one of the other guests at my table. the server was less than pleased that he got stuck with the 17 top and it showed when the birthday girl asked if the fish was fishy and he replied and order something else.and  we didn't expect a discount on anything and if we did we would have asked for it. our bill was over a grand, i'm sure anything that you would have offered would have been minimal in comparison to the headache of this yelp review and the bad wom. even after the fact you are still not taking responsibility and shifting blame.	0
take rsvp people! no place is worth waiting for an hour for a table with no good answer from the hosts when you'll get seated! it's sardine-style seating, loud, smelly, your clothes will smell food for the day. i don't care how good or bad the food is, it's a lousy management, its outrageously disorganized!	0
i would like to add an update to my past review. after trying some of the different food they offer. my choice as the best persian restaurant in town is zaytoon.  the atmosphere is still the same which is why i won't give a 5-stars because for me, a restaurant is not only about the food but the atmosphere of the place as i said earlier.  food 4.5/5: my past review was a 3.5/5 and i'm giving them a +1 since my last review mainly because the food is good. their zereshk polo is excellent and they have good kababs. definitely a good place to eat some good food. last but not least, the bread is a killer! you should definitely order some kashke bademjan with it! service 5/5: really nothing to say about the service. the family is always here to make sure that you're doing good and you like the food. they're great people and that is why i will always support them when i'm in vegas. my past review was a 4 but i have to say that the service that you get here is higher than average!  give it a try, you won't be disappointed.	1
i have been to many different locations and the food is not thesaurus. my food was not even edible. will not be back.	0
me and my girl ordered the manly burger and when they brought it out, the size of the burger immediately fooled us because the patty was huge and filled us both up! i suggest the manly burger and their fries were great!! i don't usually eat ketchup but their ketchup recipe is amazing!!!! be careful it is very easy to miss this location on hollywood and vermont!	1
to be perfectly honest, i enjoy coming here for brunch and to people watch. since they're right around the corner from a studio, you'll usually spot someone famous if you happen to be here at the right time.   but i digress...i was first drawn in by the fact that they have a large selection of cupcakes, of which, red velvet is my favorite. i've tried a variety of their sandwiches, wraps, and salads. all of which are consistently good.   one of my favorite drinks to get is pineapple mint lemonade. it hits the spot on hot summer day.   get here early, since it's a hot spot for brunch/lunch. you can either valet for parking, or find a spot in the neighborhood. but don't forget to read all the parking signs. you've been warned.	1
okay-- to summarize:  - great outdoor ambiance - fun electro music  - good drinks - fun bartenders - delicious happy hour (chicken wings, garlic wasabi fries!) - super close (to me)  i'd like to think of this place as and my local barand  :p	1
the food is great, but their service is terrible. i've gotten less than accommodating service the two times that i've been here.   this time on a monday morning we arrive 15 minutes before breakfast ends, they say we have to wait 15 minutes to be seated for lunch to start, and mind you there are plenty of tables. they only took about 7 min to seat us, but they werent serving breakfast anymore. i came for some breakfast food, not an expensive sandwich. and breakfast is supposedly served from 7-11. not 7-10:45.  and a side note, they should open the darn patio seating. it's completely shaded and there's still another month or so before it gets too hot out.	0
per some recommendations we tried the fish w/ bean curd and chicken w/ small pepper. they were great! bit dissapointed with the green onion pancake appetizer (have had better).	1
cobb salad was the worst thing ive ever had. lettuce was salty and the chicken and bacon were hard as rocks. the blue cheese was super salty. none of that went well together- it was gross. the gazpacho soup was watery and spicy and nasty, could finish more than a few bites of both. freaking gross food! plus the staff are inattentive and the glasses are super dirty...told him about it and i got the same glass back without the dry lipstick all over...except it was still on the rim....wth....not rude but definitely made me feel bad that he had to get me a new glass...thats not how customers should feel fyi. the space was just not very nice...	0
hickory burger and fries were amazing. the bread is nicely toasted (grilled) which adds so much to the burger. i like a lot of toppings on my burger, but this doesn't need them, they are that good!! although i'm not a fan of bbq sauce (the hickory burger sauce has a sweetness to it), it was still delish. next time, i'll try the steak burger. service was great (my ice tea was bottomless!) and i even took a piece of pie (banana cream) to go. can't wait to go back!	1
i really like this place a lot but was really dissapointed in their management recently. i made a reservation on monday, september 20 for my birthday celebation (about 10 guests). i spoke with them, told them i wanted to have a table outside on their incredible patio. no problem i was told. everything was reconfirmed on friday, september 24th; "no problem with a table outside for my party." then when we get there on saturday, 25th at 7 pm there is no table available outside. ("oh, we're so sorry." i was told in a total insincere way.) so we ate inside...which was not the same. i feel like i was treated badly...anyway...just wanted to let you know you can't always trust them with a reservation...	0
i was recommended the canon cocktail and have to say was very impressed. on a return visit i would probably stick to these. massive points for offering manhattan flights (rye/rum/scotch) and while good i was not blown away.	1
this place is undervalued! it's really good and very reasonably priced! consistently good food!	1
food was excellent. tried multiple appetizers including charcuterie plays, foie gras  parfait, bone marrow, cheese plate. all were outstanding and prefect to share and enjoy with wine. lobster thermidor was heaven and mac and cheese did not disappoint. server was very friendly and helpful. recommended a great wine that i would not have normally tried.	1
this is a great place to go for drinks with friends and appetizers. i've been here many times for just that and it would get an extra star if just that.	0
in the month of dec '04 i took 3 friends there on 3 occasions.  dinners were the best i have had since returning from france.  i think the owners make every effort to provide the best food available in the area.  their wait staff is sophisticated and they do their best to make the dining experience memorable.  all 3 of my friends were totally impressed with the menu selections and overall atmosphere.	0
fantastic pizza with a wonderful spicy oil to drizzle on top. great salad too. excellent service with fun atmosphere. only downer was the special calamari appetizer we got talked into and did not enjoy. bring cash... they don't take most cards. dined on october 27th marco. would love to come again next trip to nyc.	1
well people i can say i took one of my friend to starbelly on sunday thinking it would be a great first impression and well so not the fact! there was no waiting in line got a seat right away by a very wonderful lady but then our waiter handsome but worthless honestly came over and ask what we would like to drink and well we both said coffee ,he said sure and also took our order . but then the fun started , after he brought the water i looked at my coffee cup and he said well its pressed coffee i said ok ,, well he left and then 15 minutes passed m and finally i ask the lady who sat us could we have coffee please she walked right up got the coffee and poured us two cups and it was wonderful , then another waiter came out brought our pizza which was wonderful and then another waiter ask us if the pizza was ok ,, we said yes but this is the funny part our waiter we started with finally came around at the end ask us if everything was good i looked at him and said yes can we have the check , he said yes here u r and it was a pleasure .i laughed due to we saw him once and attitude the rest of the time from him which made our totally experience awful so why bother trying being polite if your a jerk.. so starbelly please think about quality and not looks on the waiters ok !!! i left no tip! a penny would be too much..	0
this is by far the worst treatment as a customer i have ever received in my life!usually, i give workers in the food industry some breathing room because i work in the food industry as well and there can be bad days, but this is by far the worst treatment i have ever received as a customer.service:first off, i walk in and they tell me to sit wherever they like. after that, i wasn't approached by any of the waiters for over 20 minutes. once finally approached, i was handed a menu and left to look over it for another 10 minutes. as i turned around to grab someone's attention, i caught them playing on their phones and talking to each other. the waiter finally approached me and gave me good attention but seemed like he was a bit unfamiliar with the menu (more on this later). after eating, i turned around to grab the attention of the waiter to ask for my check. sure enough, they were all back on their phones. i walked up for my check and left.restaurant atmosphere:the new remodeling of the space was nice. nice wood finish on most of the inside. they had a projector of music videos being played but it would be stopped for minutes at a time creating very awkward moments of eating in silence. the screen itself was in a very awkward place where as you approach the cash register, it was blinding if you turned towards the right.food:i went there for lunch time and the lunch menu included 6 wings (soy garlic flavored), potato wedges, a soda for $9.99. i also ordered a broccoli salad with my lunch combination at $5 and some change (i forgot the actual price). the order in which i received the wings first, soda, potato wedges, and lastly the broccoli salad. you would think that the first things to come out would be the ones you don't actually cook. they gave me about 6 wings with the soy garlic flavored but they were tiny, but that's what kyochon is known for. wings that are tiny and will not fill you up unless you eat 100 of them. the potato wedges were a bit bland and the broccoli salad was pretty good. i got the dressing on the side because it it very strong and it could definitely overpower the food itself but the worst of all was the hair that i found in my broccoli salad. the staff didn't care at all and i went on my way.overall: the service is the worst that i have ever received. the food was mediocre at best since the wings are tiny and the broccoli salad had a hair inside of it. there are plenty of other wing places in la that have better service, better food, and better portions. i am most def not coming back to this establishment.	0
i love their champagne special on sundays!! you can't beat $12 for a bottle of champagne and an amazing view. the service can vary depending who waits on you, but overall everyone is nice and happy. their desserts are the bomb! i've been here tons of times, but never had any food except the sliders. the one time we did want to order food we waited 45 minutes!!! the bartendar that took our food order didn't put it in!	1
noah's has been a staple of bremerton for decades. there is definitely a reason why. they are a great burger joint.	1
love it here!!!	0
every dish is delicious! especially love the caprese salad and rice balls as appetizers!	1
generous portions and friendly service!  while i was there, two people tried to dine and dash and the waitresses chased them down outside, but was very courteous!  they have a lot of dishes that you probably won't find anywhere else, especially not at any mongolian bbq spots. family run and authentic.   tried the handmade noodles and it was bomb! also got the beef dumplings with sour cream dip and that also tasted pretty good, although it was more subtle/mild so i added some hot sauce.   would definitely come back again to try more dishes!	1
i don;t think the problem with momofuku ssam bar is that they are calling this traditional korean style 'ssam' a burrito because it is in fact their twist of a burrito. the original momofuku ssam = a triple oily, poorly put together and not so tasty one. you can definitely taste that sweet fish sauce. all the ingredients were sort of stuffed in different sections so it was hard to get a taste of everything in one bite. do they always do that? they should put all that shredded goodness, mix it in a pot and for chrissake's please hold all the massive grease! by the end.. i used a fork to pick at it. although i did agree that the $10 price is great for the huge size of that one burrito at this place. you may look like a cheapo at dinnertime ordering their pre-made ssam as your entree but if you were dying to try it like i was.. who cares. hitachino red and white ale available. too dark in there. waiters who obviously favor the big spenders. ridiculous bar (it was a square block table) waiting area near the kitchen. sitting at the long bar looked cool though. table service was not worth it.. the only good point was that they had plenty of loose napkins on the table to wipe your greasy ass hands. the steamed pork buns as apps were quite delicious. i would go back for those babies. that is all.	0
just happened to be walking down the street and stopped for a frozen custard. it was okay, portion size was good, just nothing amazing about it.	0
the fries were the highlight. i think the quality of the beef is too low to contribute to the taste of the burger hence the amount of sauce used is way out of balance and dominates the flavor. i liked the patty size options the theme of the joint the location and the milkshake but ultimately the cost/value ratio was totally out of whack. probably would not return at those prices.	0
thanks to yelp we came to this joint for lunch since i wanted to go to the team la store a few minutes drive away. i parked my car next to the place which had $9 weekend rate parking. we had to wait a little over five minutes to wait. it was worth it. i ordered the chicken panini. very good choice! it came with house chips that were also good. there is very limited booth seating indoors and there are a good amount of outdoor seating. the restroom is hidden in the parking garage and you will need a token to go inside.	1
tried the bentley, tomato soup and chocolate chip cookies. all were excellent.  one thing to note is this place is more of a casual fast food place. so it is a little pricey but i do think that it is worth the money. highly recommend the bentley and getting their chocolate chip cookies, which i think might be among the best i've ever had. the soup was ok but i'd take the house chips over the soup as a side as they were much more memorable.	1
great cafe with a beautifully modern and eclectic ambience. this is a great place to sit and study or work with a delicious chai or espresso. be aware though, there are designated "laptop free" and "study free" tables. these are tables in which the use of laptops or individual studying is not allowed. although it may seem contrary to what one might expect from a cafe, when i asked one of the baristas they explained that it was put in place by the owner to encourage more face to face interactions while in the cafe. when you put it that way, it doesn't seem so bad. in addition, there are plenty tables and seating for those would like to study and use laptops. seating and table restrictions aside, this is a great cafe this take great care in preparing the perfect drink for every customer in addition to the delicious foods and pastries to pair. you may pay a bit more than your local starbucks but it's definitely well worth it!	1
never would i have imagined myself writing a yelp review complaining about a restaurant but thought the need to after receiving the worst customer service of my life at this place.   my friend and i came in around 1:30pm on saturday, waited about 30 minutes and got seated. we didn't get our water until 20 minutes in, finally having to ask the waitress for it. no one came by to ask how things were--okay whatever, it's saturday brunch in nyc. it's busy, we get it. but you can clearly see the servers just chilling on the side together, sipping on coffee, chit-chatting. it was pretty hard to get their attention. we got our food on a decent pace (thank yous to the kitchen!) and almost took 10 minutes to get a server by us to ask for the check. after paying, one of the girls came by and asked if everything was okay and how service was. we told her honestly saying that it was pretty slow. she responded saying that it is saturday and brunch time. my friend mentioned some of the servers talking, standing, drinking coffee on the side. she says and okayand  and walks away. when she came back to drop off our change, she states and why don't you guys try being on your feet for 9 hoursand  in the nastiest and rudest tone of voice ever. the more ironic thing is i'm a server myself and the friend i came with is a cook at a very fast-paced restaurant.   food was nothing more than mediocre. i've had much better avocado toast at joseph leonard. baked eggs with sausage were too overcooked in our opinion. smoked trout salad was bland. definitely not worth a second visit especially with the service from hell.	0
definitely the worst restaurant experience i've ever had!!! i really doubt the credibility of the reviews here. i've never rated any restaurant lower than 4-star before.  it is only a little restaurant with edible food and horrible service.   we got the seats really fast because there was no waiting line. and then we were served 40 minutes later! we did ask for the waiter and he kind of ignored us for a very long time. i couldn't believe that they served the group behind us! then we got our food 30 minutes later than that. then! we got the wrong food.   seriously, just don't risk your mood or vacation in this place!	0
meh. wasn't horrible, but i won't be back.	0
great food, good service, priced right. we enjoy the atmosphere each time we go thereand we only need to pay 1/2 price points on wednesday!!	1
one of the best in madtown.	0
just got done eating there. waitress was a bit rude said herself that she was unfamiliar with the menu and misquoted the price of the margaritas during happy hour as 2.75 but on our bill they were 3.50. when i asked about it we were told that she had made a mistake sorry. that's all. she was now gone and this was a gentleman. i feel we should have had our bill reduced don't you ?	0
complete gem...hidden in a shopping center!! my new husband and i stopped here after our flight into miami for a quick dinner. we had no idea how amazing this food was going to be.  the service was beyond attentive and the food was so good that we both stuffed ourselves beyond capacity. we started with the zuppa di vongole: clams with roasted garlic, herbs, and white wine. i cannot say enough how much we loved that broth! i had the rigatoni anacapri with prosciutto, onions, and famous pink creamy sauce...phenomenal! my husband had the pollo alla parmigiana breaded chicken breast with san marzano tomatoes and melted mozzarella (chicken parm) which was really good as well. from my past experiences, some of the very best family restaurants are in deceiving strip malls...this one fits that bill. if i ever fly into miami and have to stay near the airport again i will return to this restaurant for sure!	1
like everyone else on here seems to be saying; great food served wicked late, well-chosen beers, and nice cocktails. service is solid and good; words i chose carefully because one time it was warm, spectacular service that made me feel as if i'd lucked into my new favorite place in the city, while another time it was perfectly adequate with nothing particularly warm about it but no mistakes. whatever, i don't need my hand held every second! so far i tried the putine which was exactly what my tipsy self needed, fried pickles which were a huge order and tasty, and the seasonal burger which was messy but absolutely delicious (at the time the seasonal burger had creamed spinach and mascarpone on it). the beers are great even though i'd prefer something that doesn't expand my midsection as quickly as it does. with that burger i had a bitter, a saison, and a summer ale. definitely worth a visit!  cash only	1
ella's deli is too close to my house not to go there. i don't see myself ever being a regular, but it's a fantastic place for kids. it keeps them busy and even gets them to eat a little. ella's needs some major improvements in their food selection. we have bought their ice-cream multiple times and wereways happy with it. when i finally took my niece there to look at all the amazing decor they have, we decided to give their food a try and it was not impressive at all. we tried their hot dogs and fries, a ruben and coleslaw and a soup. all of which were bland and happily forgettable. we still left the place with a smile as my niece loved everything she saw there, and ate some of her food even though she didn't like it just to stay there a bit longer.	0
everytime i am in vegas i go here and its always outstanding every single time	1
the food was good, nice portions and the chef's preparation of our food right in front of us was great! our server was very attentive, helpful and friendly. was pleasantly surprised to see benihana's located in a village-type setting with restaurant on  different levels. would recommend as we would definitely return.	1
all talk! they do not care if they do not get your business!	0
been here about 5 times and the two times i'm here i ordered my karaage chicken super greasy and i mention it to the server then she said no it is the salad dressing and the chicken suppose to be greasy not crunchy! i was politely ask to fix my karaage issues but she come back with the same chicken saying i will just take it off the check instead of fixing it correctly!!! the owner is not here by the way!!! very disappointing, not sure if im going to return to this place again!!!	0
i was really excited to come here, so much that i brought 3 co-workers. the food is good, but not good enough that poor management is completely overlooked. they were out of every variety of coleslaw except for some sub-par bruschetta, and also out of green bean fries at 1:00 on a thursday afternoon. forgot our drinks, credit card machine was down... whatever, this can be overlooked - i open up my box of 3 chicken strips, there were 2 and a little crumb. getting a little frustrated at this point i asked for them to bring me the 3 strips that i ordered - dude comes out of the kitchen, tells me something about how the chicken is free-range and really expensive and refuses to do anything about me being unhappy.  here's the deal dude - if you're doing a crap job of keeping your business basics together, at least appease the customers so they can leave happy. i won't come back to your restaurant not because the food isn't good, it's because you're a douche bag that told me about how the chicken is organic and expensive instead of just fixing the problem. your rusty tables left orange marks all over my pants.	0
i love far bar.  i go here a lot. it just appeals to my sensibilities. hip but not overbearingly annoying, quaint and quirky enough not to attract a huge crowd, with a small hide-away entrance that adds to the understated flair.  the food is very decent-- i think i've tried most of the things on there, the bartenders are all very nice and personable, happy hour prices are very reasonable.  the music when i went is mostly very good forward looking edm.  try chicken wings - good  the sliders - good but overpriced  garlic fries - a must when watching the lakers	1
was not impressed. went there excited with some friends based on the 1000+ really good reviews and from hearing about it from friends. when we got there, there wasn't a wait which was nice. after we were seated, our service went downhill. service was slow and the food was disappointing. the fried pig ears were too salty and mostly breading. we tried a caesar salad with a sardines and quail egg which would've been ok if the dressing wasn't drowning the entire salad. the sardine was house cured and was pretty good, but wasn't enough to make our experience any better. after a dish was completely forgotten, we gave up and asked for the check. our total was about $24 plus some change. my friend put down $40 and the exact change. the waitress opened up the check and saw the $40 and asked if we needed change. does that mean she thinks she deserves a $16 tip for a $24 meal?? she saw that my friend left change and said that they don't accept change and that she would round down. when she finally came back with the change (i couldn't understand why everything took so long since it wasn't very busy), she had rounded up.  i had an overall great experience with the chicago restaurant scene but the purple pig really stuck out to me as less than stellar.	0
love this place it has multiple personalities so take this review with a grain of salt...  weekdays/happy hour: chill spot, kings of leon-type of vibe, think les creeping into williamsburg with soho folk. i'll take it. came here for a spanish-practice date with a classmate and really enjoyed playing hangman on the chalk board tables and another time with coworkers for after work brewskies. both times we had tentative service and decently priced drinks and not a problem finding seating. only problem was the arctic breeze that accompanied the booths on the right hand side of the bar.  late night/weekends: this place starts to feel more lounge-y with a dj spinning everything from amy winehouse (rip sister) to outkast to drake to the cure. i like it. keeps the super diverse crowd pleased and their buzz going. i appreciate that this bar has so many different and placesand  to hang around in, and that the bar is a legitimate place to post up and spend the night as the place is built around it. getting in a game at the billiards table has never been a problem for me either.   you can easily dance the night away here, enjoy a beer after work, or meet some new people on a friday night. it is a nice alternative to the massive crowd at blackbird. fingers crossed to hoping it lasts.	1
i really love this place at wynn and all vegas. so modern and chic. service is very good and the food is more than excellent. i want to go back there!	1
the food was ok. but you gotta watch your $. these waiters will try to overcharge you in every way they can find. don't leave your receipt cause the will give themselves a huge tip!!	0
food was fantastic! very italian. service was on point and not overbearing but kept us comfortable.	1
ran in on my lunch hour. asked for soup and salad to go. i dont mind paying $1100 dollars for lunch but i need more then a few bites. soup was bland and the salad was ok. i wont go back.	0
so i know this place gets a little pricey but the service made my trip out to la worthwhile. do not get the tuna melt- i could have made this at home. it's literally bread, tuna, and cheese. however, i ordered it with a sweet potatoe fries w/ ranch on the side and it totally saved the meal. our waiter was super hot and the manager came by to check up on me and my friend and gave us a free red velvet cupcake because it was her birthday. the cupcake was deliciousss!	1
if it ain't ezells i don't want none!	1
i was not impressed by the customer service at this restaurant. as i asked sarah ( who had just taken beers to another table) if i could get another beer... she looked at me with a rude look and said "you have to go get it yourself" i would think that the least she could do was ask a server "her coworker" if they could attend me, but turns out she couldn't. then once she saw i was upset at her tone she proceeded to say "well since we're busy maybe you'd like a job" i am a customer!... i am not asking for anything free or discounts... why is it so hard to receive decent service here. what a way to insult a customer! anyways i would not return here anymore. the point of going to a restaurant is to enjoy the experience, however that was not the case. thanks for everything.	0
upon arrival, lunch reservations for 3 ppl not honored. waiter seated walk-in party ahead of us and forced us to wait 15 minutes. as i type this, it's 20 minutes past our reservation time and still no waiter or silver or place setting.   had to walk to server station to attract attention of server. finally our server took order, but no silverware until after food had arrived.  food quality was decent, but experience was irreparably harmed by lack of service. disaster, followed by staff indifference. do not waste your time with these amateurs.	0
very good food. the potstickers in particular were outstanding. the only negative side to this place was our waitress. houdini could've learned from her disappearing trick.	1
fresh and healthy. left very satisfied but not disgustingly full! defiantly would come back!	1
lovely spot, lots of promise. but despite ordering from every part of the menu, nearly every dish we had was served cold and with toast. the tartinettes are supposed to be like that, but when i order cod from a menu section called and poissonsand  i sort of expect a warm piece of fish, not a cold jar of spread. this place must be raking in the $$ since every $15 dish is put together by putting a scoop of pre-prepared stuff on a couple pieces of toast. the fact that it's served cold and not even room temperature reminds you that it just came out of a refrigerator. tastes pretty good for what it is, but come on!	0
pan seared watermelon steak is watermelon made to look like a steak. did not know that and was very disappointing. polenta fries were bad but i've never had polenta before so many i just don't like polenta. risotto was boring. caesar salad was odd (came with two full anchovies) but good. fish taco was alright to good.	0
pretty hard to find. the entrance is a little tiny gate in an alley with a banner hanging. i didn't think too much of it when i walked in but i was delightfully surprised. i really like this place a lot. it kinda feels like your in new york. we had wasabi fries, beer, hot sake and sushi rolls. all really good and decently priced. i must tell you about the wasabi fries. they're awesome. no seriously. it's a must have if you come here.honestly you would probably never know about this place unless someone tells you about it. the reason we went is because my friend is a server there and i promised her i would go check it out. by no means am i only saying that the food and service was good because of her. everything actually was. it wasn't packed at all but i came on a tuesday. apparently, they even have a dj on the weekends and it gets pretty packed from what i hear. definitely a nice place to check out if your in the area.ohh one more review to go for my 100th. i wonder what it'll be...	1
great place for an after-work meet up. rooftop pool feels very la, but in a good way, not pretentious and scene-y like others. great food, though i wish the menu had more selections. cozy fire pit area is intimate and romantic. great views, great place to bring an out-of towner here on business.service pretty slow, however, at least all the times i've been there. forget it on a friday night its so crowded and uncomfortable you'll want to jump off the side of the building. overall, i dig. oh, careful of the hotel valet. they're disorganized and pretty unprofessional. (but come on, they're valet people and i can't hold it against)	1
after a very unsatisfying delivery experience, the manager and owner both reached out to me immediately to resolve the situation.   very impressed with their customer service and very excited to try their food at the belmont location in chicago. cannot comment on the actual food yet, but from previous reviews and the outstanding customer service i received, i am sure it will be a very positive experience.	1
consider this a 4.5 star review.  this is probably the best place to go if you can't decide what you want to eat because they have pretty much every kind of taco to hit those different tastebuds.  there is 21 tacos ranging from tikka chicken to bacon burger to cuban pig. i am a regular here and have now tried every taco on the menu (besides the seafood category because of an allergy).  my standard order is three tacos, and usually i get tots on the side. this will easily last 1.5 meals. my favorites are the roast pork frittata/chilaquile #20 and the tikka chicken #3  the tots - let me put it this way - i don't even like tater tots, but i love these fancy tots. the tots have so many fixings that it's like an explosion of salty, creamy, spicy, starchy. it's crazy.  i feel the same way about they're red velvet cake. normally i despise red velvet but velvet taco just does it right, oh and if you're eating it without the butterscotch sauce you're doing it wrong.   furthermore, the space is cool and the drinks are worth it.  now, the only hold back i have from this rave is that the calamari taco my bf ate was no good he said. and on just a couple occasions my stuff came too wet (tots were oily and the tacos had too much sauce) but these are so minor and could happen anywhere that it's pretty much null.  so, the next time you are arguing about what to eat, remember me and just go here! in fact, just go here in general.	1
this is like pretty much my favorite place to eat in miami. every weekend after hanging at the vagabond or on the beach i stroll down to the gables and order a pan con bistec at 4am. it's super cheap and super freaking delicious. i actually had my birthday party there one year, there are a few tables outside in the back that accommodated my friends and we had steak sandwiches and cake after partying with rusko at the white room (eve now). also where else on the planet can you get a smoothie at three o'clock in the morning?	1
so cute, i felt like i was walking into a crate and barrel commercial.  whats up with the couches? is redhook becoming miami? and there was a mangy looking cat that appears to own the place, dont give him tips, he will just spend it on katnip!  the muscles were amazing. served with a thin toast. toast is usually delicious, but this stuff was mana.  great place for a casual bite and some wine with friends, although it was date night city when i went...	1
great location, great service and delicious meal! went with a colleague and friends and we ordered a couple pies and a couple salads- salads were fresh and flavorful. pizza was so good and light.	1
overpriced, horrible service, an undercooked burger brought to the table not as ordered, a 10 dollar burger portioned so small it should have been classified as a slider and the next day everyone in my party has the runs! this place is as ridiculous as it gets. our waiter was one of those well intentioned, super friendly la. hipsters without a clue as to what service is about. he brought our drinks in bottles and neglected to bring glasses. three attempts at asking for glasses with ice and all we got was "ok, sure i am getting those for you" only to get zip. when the food arrived my pork burger special was raw in the middle. when i was finally able to locate the waiter i sent it back only to be told it was cooked properly and didn't need further grilling. i guess getting a meal cooked the way you want it and not the way the cook wants to send it out to you is not possible at this place. our waiter, not knowing what to do or say sent the manage over. a nice guy, he took my bad burger away and replaced it with another burger, this time cooked properly but not the burger i had ordered. on top of that, it had a strange and unfamiliar flavor that no burger should have. after leaving hungry, angry and price gouged we all spent the next day with stomach "issues". don't eat here... it is wrong on so many levels, like food, service, price and portion size.	0
i went to street about a week ago and i must say the food was very good. my family and i ordered quite a bit off the menu and was not mad at all. the whole fish snapper, peri peri wings, curry chicken,whole chicken, lamb was a bit bland but hey. sister finished off the octopus before i could even taste it ...so i guess it was alllllll good.jerk pork, shark and bake, hot dogs, corn soup and complimentary of the chef was the fried pork. yes if you are west indian you already know how this food could be taken up a notch but it was very good. i must say we were very pleased and wil be back. we didnt drink so i can't even talk about that but i will save that for the next visit. the staff was very nice,and chef roble was also there and stopped by the table to to let us know about a few more projects that he was working on.	1
double-double animal style is delish. it always makes me wanting it first thing when on the west coast.  .. too bad the one i had here in vegas was dry, and tasted like crap. i was trying to imagine the time i had it in san fran and was in burger heaven, but nope, crap.	0
i went here recently for a private family party. the party was fun, but the experience with the staff here was unpleasant, to say the least.  first off, when we got there half an hour early to set things up, as we were told to do, nothing was ready. tables and chairs weren't set up until 5 to 10 minutes before our scheduled party was supposed to start. guests were arriving and the staff was still moving things around. the hostess who met with us and was apparently our coordinator was flat out rude the entire time. we were nothing but nice and polite and she gave us a sour attitude and monotone answers to every question. we had brought flowers to decorate and another staff member who was supposed to be helping us out basically let the front door slam in my mother's face when she was carrying a box of flowers into the restaurant.  the upside was the food was pretty good and three of the food servers (two younger guys in their early 20s and an older woman) were very nice and helpful. the decor upstairs is nice. i liked all the photos of cuba on the walls.  wrapping up the party, the same rude hostess made us wait another half hour for the extra food we had already paid for, even though we finished eating more than an hour before our party was scheduled to finish. when i asked the hostess about it, she was rude, as normal. i've become used to restaurant staff in miami restaurants being cold and impolite, but this lady was one of the worst i'd ever come in contact with. should customers really be treated like an inconvenience? needless to say, the 3 nice servers got an extra tip and the rude hostess did not.   i wouldn't recommend this place to host a private party and i don't plan on eating here again when i visit family in miami. i'd rather go to sergio's or even la carreta. the food is just as good and the service at those places has always been better.  oh, and they stole all of our pens.	0
go here before this place blows up. it's amazing. went for the $10 for $20 deal, and every single thing we ordered was phenomenal. i got the chicken sandwich (with lots of help from the incredibly nice waiter) and my girlfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich. i also tried the mango shake (two thumbs up!) and we got sweet plantains too. the neighborhood is low key, the food and service are spectacular. check this place out asap.	1
the la location is major disappointment for the keizo shimamoto brand. i experienced the "original" ramen burger at the nyc manhattan location a few months back and was positively impressed, leaving me a fan. i was really looking forward to introducing a friend to the concept at the la location, but walked away completely disappointed. i ordered the spicy version, which supposedly comes with sriracha in the secret sauce. the burger i received had barely, if any sauce on it, the beef patty was dry and there were vague traces of something resembling spiciness. the ramen buns were crispy and adequately cooked, but overall the concoction failed because, like any burger, it is "made" by the juiciness of its middle.the differences with its nyc siblings extend to more than the meal. while the manhattan restaurant has a modern decor with a chic vibe, in la you are served from a hole-in-the-wall next to a nightclub on a busy major street. this may help sales, especially late at night on weekends, but for those seeking the culinary experience, the noisy and grimy setting, with two tiny tables only one of which has chairs, is an instant turnoff. and you can pretty much forget about parking nearby.due to this lousy experience, i have no intention of revisiting the la location - the brand's reputation has been permanently tarnished for me. maybe i'll try it again in brooklyn. or maybe not.	0
i had been sorely disappointed by the food in miami, but the saving grace was this counter spot in little havana. friendly chef, good moist roast chicken with plantains and rice. generous portions. forget the other places.	1
amazing!! their fried pickles are delicious!	1
deeeeeeelicious! i came here with my parents for my birthday and we had a lovely time. we came on a sunday and one of us got the prefix menu (we all tasted and loved it), another one of us had the steak, and i had the macaroni and cheese with a side of green beans. aside from the delicious food, the service was exceptional and the wine i had (a cap franc) was full bodied with an incredible flavor. i ordered some sort of chocolate coffee mousse for dessert and savored every bite. the ambiance is casual-dressy, the space is charming, and the staff is friendly. i can't wait to go back!	1
food/taste: 5 stars service: 5 stars (fast, friendly) parking: street parking, not difficult to find.  my boyfriend took me here for dinner on a sunday night, and the place was poppin' till closing. we were lucky enough to be able to sit in 1 of 3 booths with draping curtains on the sides--the atmosphere was quite romantic, i must say :) -- dim lights and candles on the tables.  here's what we ordered:   1) and tasty burgerand  meyer's ranch beef patty grilled with french fries: we preferred the patty to be medium rare, but our server suggest we get medium, and it was perfectly cooked-- still tender. the vegetables were fresh and crispy, and even the french fries were perfect (when it was still hot).   2) braised boneless short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes, kale and a red wine jus: ohhh just thinking about it makes me hungry again. i didn't know short ribs could be so tender! i must say though, the flavor was a bit on the salty side, but luckily, the mashed potatoes made up for it.  3) make your own s'mores - molten marshmallow, bittersweet chocolate, and house made graham cookies [for dessert]: omg *droool* my boyfriend actually heard about this dessert before, that it is one of those things you must try. i don't even know where to start. it came in cute little cups (one with dark bitter chocolate, and the other with melted marshmallows) with candles on the bottom to keep them warm. you just gotta see it for yourself and taste the orgasmic sensation in your mouth!  approx. total for these dishes: $45, an excellent value!  i would definitely go again to try more dishes!	1
came here already eating pork the last 2 days. so when we got here, tried to vary it up. at first, i told the server i wanted the 8 sauces combo. he says yes and proceeds to say it would be for the 2 people combo. i assumed that i had ordered the 8 sauces...then our order comes out, and none of the pork belly with the sauces come out. i was frustrated and told the young guy, but he brushed it off by saying he thought we said otherwise. i even showed him my coupon! which i had gotten about a yr ago for a and special treat.and  turns out that treat was included in the 8 sauces combo. thanks, dude.  anyway, we had beef and pork neck/belly without the 8 sauces. the meats were all right. there are plenty other kbbq places that taste better, i wasn't impressed. i'll give this place another shot so hopefully they'll get my order right. but for now food and service was so so.	0
if i want a well done burger give me a well done burger! when i ordered a burger well done the female cashier had a grin on her face and told me the well done burgers don't taste good here so i should order it medium or medium well. i took her suggestion and ordered it medium well and sure enough i get a bloody red undercooked burger. i should have read yelp reviews before i came here because other people are having similar issues.	0
i was so excited when the double windsor opened up in the neighborhood and have had a number of good experiences there over the years. however, the last few times i went, the bartenders were horrible! (the guy bartenders!!, i've never had a problem with the female bartenders). they act as though they're doing you a favor for just doing their job. i once stood with a friend at the bar for about 15 minutes waiting to be served. there were 2 bartenders working. one was taking care of other customers and the other was updating the chalkboard with not a care in the world that there were bar guests waiting to be served (we weren't the only ones waiting). finally, as the one guy continued to take his merry old time updating the chalk board (not a priority, in my opinion, when there are guests waiting to be served), the other bartender finally came over to us, was not pleasant whatsoever, a barely mumbled and what can i get youand  in a most arrogant way. we were so annoyed with the attitude, that we just left and went across the street to farrell's where we were promptly served with a smile. they might not have the beer selection that dw has, but at least their bar staff are attentive and not arrogant.  another time i was there with a couple of friends late on a thursday night. we stayed pretty late, but it was not past the closing time. the bartender clearly wanted to close the place and was going around and removing the candles from all the tables. we were one of a few tables left and we asked if we could keep the candle on the table because it's quite dim in there, and we even said we'll bring the candle up to the bar when we leave. but the bastard of a bartender said no and took the candle off our table! i can see if it was past closing time, but the bar was still open!!   this is going back a bit, but really bothered me enough to include it in this review. during world cup, they had a sign outside inviting people to come in and watch the world cup. it was usa v. ghana and the bar was definitely more crowded because of people wanting to watch the game. they had the tv on and when the game was about to start, i asked when they were going to turn on the volume. the bartender told me that they were not going to turn on volume to the game per the manager of the bar. i was outraged because i specifically went there to watch the game because they were allegedly showing the game. i feel like they totally lied to get people in the bar, which is not cool.  i was going to give this 2 stars because the food is pretty good and they have a nice beer selection, but its their horrible bartenders that led me to give it just one star. stop hiring jerks for bartenders!	0
disappointing to say the least... the bistro burger was overdone, flavorless and the bun fell apart in my hands as i ate. of course the service and ambiance were poor, and although i think some people like that atmosphere, we didn't go for it. too bad because i remember liking this place much more on previous visits.	0
horrible service and disregard for customers. awful music in the evening.	0
you'd think a restaurant that moved into this neighborhood and is doing well would do more to help the community it serves. this restaurant moved in and along with it brought the loudest, most obnoxious vent with it. the vent is so loud you can hear it two blocks away and owners refuse to fix it even when it affects the lives and work of people who live nearby. i was once a customer, now i'm not and i will urge everyone to not patronize them until they fix their nasty noisy vent. good food should also come with benefiting not hurting the neighborhood they serve.	0
bardot brasserie was fantastic!  great service (after a delay in getting seated).  the food was wonderful.  the restaurant is beautiful.  i hope to go back for dinner or maybe happy hour.	1
this place is great for to-go vegan/vegetarian/health conscious food. it's nothing fancy, don't expect any impressive decor/ambiance. the space is pretty small and stuffy, but seems clean. i've only had the club sandwich and falafel wrap, and those were delicious. i love that the salad comes with quinoa. dressing is quite strong, but it's delicious so whatever. i'm sad to see the 1star review stating that she got sick from their food and that they copied their entire menu from golden mean... it sucks that you got sick, but you can't say that they copied everything from another restaurant based on the fact that the two restaurants have the same items. maybe they did, maybe they didn't i don't know since i'm not affiliated with the business but i'd just like to make my statement in their defense. i mean, how much and differentand  can 2 vegan restaurants be? especially when it comes down to a club sandwich? club sandwiches in general, vegan or not, aren't too and diverseand . of course everyone loves a unique spot, and i sure do, but this spot is unique in that they serve vegan options at all in this area/location. plus their prices are very competitive considering the fact that they are and health consciousand . i've been to tons of vegan/vegetarian/raw/gluten-free/health conscious restaurants (although i am no longer vegan, but i was for 5 years), including golden mean and others in santa monica, and this place is not that bad. it's actually pretty good. i can't say i haven't had better, but the price is right and i haven't had bad service yet so i'm pretty happy with the grain cafe.	1
this place is iconic and every time i go here it just brings an and old schooland  type of feeling that i really do enjoy. food is a classic jewish deli and diner food that you can't really find anywhere else. it's delicious, good, not quite good for those who are trying to be on a diet.   i haven't tried the matzo ball soup yet-----but i will next time!	1
i love serious pie!	1
i came here for some guacomole and nachos, i left with two tacos, a flan, a seperate order of beef nachos, and a container of guap and chips. they were all great, large portions and well priced. will come back for more	1
bbq chicken salad was soggy with no flavor. use to love this place. cheesecake has lost flavor and is too sugary now instead of densely flavored. very disappointed	0
not really clear why the hipsters have such affection for this grease pit, aside from the fact that its open late, and in a great location. the food's alright, but nothing special, and overpriced for what you get.	0
very disappointing. incredibly rude staff and mediocre food. my husband and i have been a few times and we always expect a better experience but we always leave disappointed. i won't be back.	0
we searched yelp for a good place in madison to eat on the first night of our honeymoon. we chose inka heritage because of it's uniqueness - peruvian food? okay! it was the best decision ever. we wanted a place where we wouldn't look out of place in nicer clothes - the clean atmosphere and pretty place settings gave us the environment we wanted. we ordered the ceviche mixto to start and loved it. the seafood was fresh and the variety was even. the sauce was lime-y, spicy and complex. and the hominy and sweet potato on the side were great. big yum. for the main meal, we shared the manchupiccu and the arroz verde...notendo (?). both were amazing. the manchupiccu was super savory and unique. the arrozo was hearty, with a good amount of rice, and had a large portion of the seafood. beautiful presentation on both and wonderful flavor. we got the tres leches for dessert - another success. add the nicer atmosphere and our fantastic food to the attentive and friendly service we received and you get one suberb dining experience. absolutely give this place a try!	1
you had better plan to be able to take the afternoon off from the office. we have been here for over 40 minutes and all we have are our drinks and attitude from the bar wench when we inquired to the whereabouts or our order.	0
we were in venice this past autumn and after hearing about cicchetti were excited to try it. we found a table upstairs and while it must have been one of the quieter spots in the place it was still loud. to the point that most every word spoken to our party of three was followed by a loud what? and no we're not all hard of hearing.	0
i love their umami burger it is fresh and their sauce is awesome only thing is he parking i don't rally like the fact that i have to pay for the parking	1
i went here often when i was very young; it was near both my mom and dad's offices. i completely forgot about it, and didn't head back until one night leaving the edison with a bunch of very hungry friends. now i'm regretting those lost years. the pancakes are fluffy, thick, and already a tad sweet. just a bit of butter is enough, and they melt in your mouth.the eggs are perfect greasy spoon style, with fresh sourdough bread. i could eat breakfast here anytime(at any hour). it's the perfect compliment to the up-and-coming nightlife scene downtown because, as everyone else has noted, it's never closed. haven't tried any of the lunch style items other than the fries, so can't comment there.	1
the event was my 2-year anniversary with my lovely girlfriend mel l.the ambiance and decor grade: a-are they going for a romantically lit cafe? a rustic bustling bar? i don't know, but it sets the mood for some fine dining. the place is lined with bottles of liquor throughout and the hanging lights give the place a warm atmosphere. i can do without the brick floor which made my chair rock a bit while i ate.service grade: a+i made reservations 2 months in advance so we were seated immediately after telling the hostess we preferred a window seat. our waitress holly gave her recommendations and insight on the food and was friendly and attentive all night. our waters were always refilled without us asking. similarly our bread was replaced once without us saying anything and subsequently we were asked if we wanted more. i just felt like everyone was there to make sure we were satisfied and that really made the experience memorable.food grade: a+absolutely divine. i think this is how napoleon ate- like a damn king. the beef bone marrow was rich, savory, and i'm salivating just thinking about it. the bread they give you to eat with had a wonderful buttery crunch and the pickled garnish was good as well. my girlfriend's escargot pastries were awesome! the outer layer was buttery and flaky while the escargot on the inside was tender and beautifully seasoned with wine and pesto. my braised pork belly pretty much blew my mind. it has this lovely crispy char on the outside while being fatty, juicy, and soft on the inside. the tree ear mushrooms they use had a lovely crunch and the starchiness of the fingerling potatoes helped absorb some of the fat. my only complaint is that the pork was a tad bit too salty, but i think i was just thirsty. my girlfriend had the lingcod and the fish itself was clean and well seasoned. the dish also came with this fried fish-hash brown and that was really flavorful and enjoyable to eat as well. nothing we ordered disappointed. lastly we got the creme brulee for dessert and as expected it was heavenly. they brought it out on this cute "happy anniversary" thing because of the note i left on my reservation, it was thoughtful.conclusion and price grade: aif you want to be treated and fed like a king, then you should expect to pay a bill worthy of someone who makes as much money as a king. the beautiful part is that i did not regret paying an arm and a leg to eat here. church and state was worth every penny for this particular experience. unlike animal which was over-hyped for me, church and state delivered on every level of satisfaction. this is where all the rich and beautiful people go. join them. you're welcome.there is parking across the street for $5 flat.	1
i love the mac and cheese at the old fashioned! nowhere can beat it!	0
happy hour is from 3pm-7pm everyday,only have brunch at saturday and sunday,super nice view of sunset of los angeles ,food is good,i love the fried and burger ,small swimming pool on the roof can enjoy the sunshine and cocktail in the same time. during happy hour all the cocktails will be 7 dollar.have free wifi but need to became a member first .	1
food is amazing!	1
pluses: great food.	1
the bad: parking can be a bit of a pain if you come at the wrong time. they're closed on mondays (somehow i've been foiled by this on many occasions..). again, visiting at the wrong time... you'll find yourself waiting for a seat (delaying the deliciousness that you so desperately crave), hoping that everyone is honest and the first-come rule is followed by all. but like all good things, apple pan is worth the wait.  the good: the burgers, sandwiches, fries, and pies! oh wait, that's everything on the menu!   years and years ago, when i was just a naive freshman at ucla, i was waiting at the mall to get picked up. i was enjoying some mcdonald's fries, when an older gentleman said my fries were trash and said that if i wanted really good food, then next time i'd go across the street to the apple pan (this was before the days of yelp, hmmm, i think i've really just dated myself). so i made the effort to go back to the apple pan. what a wonderful, life altering decision! the u-shaped counter, old-timey cash register, and old men hustling and bustling around add to the charm. the hickory burger is my favorite and i love the fat fries. no one i've taken here has been disappointed.   lastly, don't forget dessert! there's always room for homemade pie. apple pie with ice cream?! yes please! but the pie that changed my life is the boysenberry cream. don't get me wrong, the banana cream, chocolate, strawberry, etc. are all good and i've ordered many pies to go (for parties and such...no, not just for my own greedy obsession)....but i'll never forget that heavenly boysenberry cream pie.	1
went to see a movie the other night at the arclight theater and was looking for a spot to grub beforehand that was within walking distance. i actually started a talk thread and a fellow yelper suggested bowery. i checked out some of the reviews and quick tips and decided to give it a shot and sweet baby jesus!!! it was the most scrumptious decision i had made all week!!! i started off w/ sweet corn and crab fritters(delicious), gravy fries(the gravy is made with shredded pieces of short ribs and the flavor is incredible), both these appetizers paired perfectly with the stone ipa's i was ordering up(all their beers are in bottles or cans none on tap). the meatloaf was the surprise star of the meal for me. i was gonna order the bowery burger but the waiter totally sold me on the meatloaf when he explained that it wad made of veal,sirloin,and pork, w/ a bacon crust. served with broccolini that was seasoned and cooked perfectly and delicious mashed potatoes. but back to the meatloaf, the flavors of all the delicious cuts of meats blended together perfectly and danced across my palette with a ballet of flavor!!! service was great and prompt(from both the girl at the door to our waiter who was more than helpful with suggestions and prompt with food and drinks. i can't wait to come back again!!!	1
i went in here recently and when i came out my clothes reeked of greasey food. it was pretty disgusting. i had to air out my leather jacket out for a week until the stench finally went away. i really don't get this place. why is everyone waiting in line????	0
my first time at the six will not be my last... started with the white corn soup... omg... it smelled as good as it tasted.. then the heirloom tomato salad and the marinated beets.. so fresh, light and yummy... then the grilled salmon...everything was great the staff were attentive and the ambiance really nice... definitely recommend and can't wait to try the burger which looked amazing...	1
i went with two more friends ; who are from bulgaria and i mexicanoit's been a long time since i eat paella and what i was looking for it : was a great dishflavor and the fried goat cheese !!!!thank you for thataj moreno	1
awesome experience. i don't know which was better, the staff and service or the food... everything was great. and affordable. best pizza and wings i have had in a long time	1
the majority of chinese restaurants in my proximity had bad reviews. i was starting to think that i'd never find a good chinese restaurant to order from. i received a flyer for chun fai in my mail box so i decided to check them out online. i was pleasantly surprised to see good reviews so i called and placed my order.   the girl on the phone was very friendly and polite, she told me delivery would be 45 minutes, and took my card info to run my card.   items ordered:  -broccoli beef ($8.75) -vegetable chow mein ($6.50) -crab rangoons (free w/order)  my food was delivered in under 45 minutes and the delivery driver was really nice. there is a $2 fee for delivery, so my order came in at under $18 which wasn't bad at all. the broccoli beef came with a small order of white rice. portions were big, it was enough to feed my two boys and myself, we still had leftovers for the next day. all the food was pretty good, i really enjoyed the chow mein, it had tons of veggies in it. the broccoli beef has carrots in it and the sauce it was in had a good flavor to it. the white rice was plain but did come with soy sauce. two fortune cookies were included in my order.   overall, i was really pleased. portions and price are great, employees are friendly, delivery is fast, food is good. i'll definitely continue ordering from chun fai whenever i want good chinese food without having to drive.	1
second and last time for me. first time was after a night of clubbing and anything taste good after that.  this time i was sober and had a groupon, we both ordered the pastrami. if you love fatty meat, then this is for you. service was fast because it was empty and waitress debbie had no charisma. i'm not sure why i left a 25% tip but i did. we only ate half and took the rest home.  to me, there is nothing really special about this place -- it's an over-priced, dark diner.	0
i came here for brunch, it's in a very quite and cute neighborhood, it's a great spot for outdoor eating. however, the food itself is very typical and boring brunch food, nothing to write home about or worth going to again.	0
me and my boyfriend had the worst experience ever. i am from the us, but living in buenos aires, so we had our argentinian driving license, which for some reason works to rent a car, but they wouldn t let us buy a beer. i looked it up and there is no miami law that says that a foreigner license can t be accepted. unfortunately there s no law against discrimination   on top of that they said it in a really rude way and pretended they didn t understand our english. we've lived in ny for a year, and have travelled everywhere because of our jobs, we have gone out to the coolest parties and bars before and had never suffered from discrimination.  reponse to owner:  weird that you seem to be the only bar in miami following that law. anyways, upsetting that miami laws only consider us states valid states. a city with the ammount of turist miami has discriminating against our id's, absurd. who in their fair judgmenet would go partying with a passport?  even if this was a law, which i still have my doubts your bartenders and managers were rude to us pretending they couldn t understand us and saying we weren t worth talking to and this is what this bad review is about.   one thing i also find annothing: what s the point of mentioning that people who work at the bar have colombian and guatemalean descendence? why do americans feel that every latin speaking country have a bound or are similar in a way? argentinians certainly don t have nothing to do with colombian or guatemalean culture, we are if anything more french or italian, that's where all atentinian inmigration comes from  you just owe us an apology dude, that's a little advice for you so you don't loose customers. is that so hard? are we seriously the first foreigners who didn't 't bring the passport to the bar?	0
it has been awhile since i have put out a review... i've been to countless places and none feel worth mentioning whether it was good or bad...  but....  yama-san... so skillful... chisake-chan... so attentive...  yamakase... a excellent harmony...  thank you... what a delightful experience... it has giving me the inspiration i need to do the simple task of simply typing a review which so many others failed to do...  what this was... i can't completely describe... i do know this though, it was purely blissful and delightful. rest assured you have a pallet for beautiful, wondrous ingredients prepared with technique you shall be satisfied.   my dining experience of what i elegantly devoured can not be describe.. i am sorry for being unable to do so.. a wonderful euphoria of pleasure will put you in a state of a wonderful delirium that will cause you to lose track of what you ate... i'd rather not even spoil the surprise... but that is impossible... if you ever have the chance that you will state your case to be chosen, then fate has something wonderful in-stored for you.  i will give you all one tip.. please try a glass of red wine made by a friend of yama-san. its certainly a glass worthy of complimenting any of the world's riches.  you coming here my cause you to tear like i did...	1
don't like this place at all!!! 	0
this thanksgiving i'm thankful for petee's pie! tried it first time on thanksgiving day on their 2nd day of opening. had a medley of 4 types of slices, everything was delicious. filling was so soft and creamy, and those crusts, flaky, buttery, dreamy...	1
i like this place only because i discovered the most dangerous and best beer i've discovered in a while. it's called the stoic and it's 11% alcohol by volume. dangerous, dangerous drink, and oh did i mention it was dangerous?more info here: love the high ceilings, and love that it's not too crowded when i come.	1
good coffee, sandwich, cookies and fun staff. sandwich came with a cookie instead of chips, and kind of pricey for amount of food ($11) , but strongly recommend stopping in here.	1
very delicious sandwiches for sale here. this isn't your run of the mill sandwich shop as they have a bunch of cool different choices. the asian roast pork is very tasty. you must try the fried chicken sandwich. the fries are also very good and served in the big chinese take out cartons. great spot to grab a sandwich.	1
2 complaints-i don't live in la anymore so i don't get here often enough and i don't recommend eating inside when it's crowded, which is almost always...the place gets stinky and kind of dirty.... i much prefer sitting outside plus people watching is always the highlight.super trendy, post partying hollywood crowd. it gets crowded later in the morning and afternoon when everyone has finally woken up after a long night out partying. it's fun to see who looks the most hungover or still strung out...anyway, the food is awesome. doesn't really matter what you get. i'm a huge breakfast person so i almost always order breakfast food. and, yes, as with almost all other yelpers, you shouldn't leave without ordering a cupcake to go!	1
of all the reviews we read, the bad ones about service turned to be accurate. we didnt get to order, so i'm not sure if the food is good. we sat down. after a while we had to call someones attention. he said he only serve drinks but he will call our server. we got water... i could see three servers around but another 8 minutes passed and we left. total of 15 minutes, 5 tables occupied 6-7 servers/ drink servers around. am i wrong here?	0
came here a month ago on a random sunday. my girlfriends were around the corner from me and told me to meet up with them for happy hour. i heard happy hour and i was all game, right who would pass that up on a sunny sunday? so they have me meet them here at canter's. huge sign in the front about their happy hour we walk inside and its a restaurant. they lead us to the bar and it's completely empty. we all looked at each other and laughed out of desperation and just seated ourselves. long story short the happy hour was alright 2-3 for a beer and they had food on the happy hour menu. personally i don't like drinking while i eat so i did a pass. maybe next time i'll go and eat instead of being a alcoholic and hitting the boring happy hour.	0
it's divey, a hole in the wall, and parking is a pain, but i loved every minute of it!!  like the name say's, the featured item on the menu is crab, crab, and more crab. alaskan king crab, dungenness, and maryland blue! all scrumptiously garlicky and finger licking amazing! if you're not into the frou-frou white tablecloths and dainty waiters, this is the place to go for crab!  i used to live down the street from the place many mango seasons ago, and never quite made it in there. then one day out of the blue, i had a hankering. i asked my friends to join me and suddenly we were five people smacking crab with mallets. i tell you, the bibs are really needed here.  if you're not sure what to get, order the sampler platter. it comes with three (or four) varieties of crab and a couple of sides. me being me, i pass on the sides and dive into the main platter. i mean who eats potatoes when you've got crabs!!  a few things to remember, first, don't expect five star service here. it's very casual and friendly, so relax and go with the flow. secondly, bring the family. the prices are unbeatable and who better to share this place than with your own. thirdly, loosen those belts or wear stretchy pants, because you're going to eat, eat, eat!  the restaurant accepts credit cards, and you can order for take-out as well.   if you eat in, remember to leave the tip in cash. your server will appreciate it!	1
great meal, great service, and great atmosphere in the outdoor cafe, under the ivy. everyone in my group enjoyed their meal. the specialty beers were excellent.	0
average for brunch. prix fixe is reasonable for nyc standards but there is nothing remarkable about the food. decor and wait staff aside, it's not french by any stretch of the imagination. my food was bland and shapeless--and who serves french fries at brunch? hash browns would be better. not to mention my and wild mushroomand  omelette was placed on top of the side salad, wilting all the lettuce and destroying its flavor. (come to think of it, neither the mushrooms nor supposed cheese could be tasted.)  your average diner will give you a tastier breakfast.	0
first, i didn't realize that the location was so far from our house. it was listed as a and deal nearbyand  even though it was over 25 minutes away. i am a huge fan of kogi in california. i had the pleasure of eating kogi at coachella last year.  so, i was thrilled that a korean-mexican fusion restaurant was here in vegas. so, after driving forever, we arrived. the first thing i was greeted with was and we are closed and we didn't lock the doors. but if you order now, you can take it to go.and  thanks to everyone's reviews i knew what to order.  the bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. the fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it. the meat didn't have the marinated flavor everyone talked about. the bulgogi burrito had a lot of rice and beans, lots of filler. the highlight was the spam musubi. the spam was fried and crispy.   so my experience could be just bad because we got there at closing. i would have rather left than paid for ok food and received the impression i was inconveniencing the owners.	0
my boyfriend and i wanted to try someplace new and found this place on urban spoon it was close so we decided to go! the food is good but what blew us away was this amazing waitress! literally the best customer service we have ever had! even though the food was good (the fried rice is delicious an amazing) the service is what will bring us back.	1
came here for drinks and appetizers on a friday night. order hendricks martini and meatball appetizer. the martini was well made but they didn't have blue cheese olives. the meatballs were amazing. flavorful. a great recommendation from yelp. the complimentary bread was great for dipping in the left over sauce. can't wait to come back and try dinner!	1
i have visited carmines several times and have not been disappointed.  the atmosphere, staff and meals remind me of sunday dinner at grandmas.  food is fabulous and service is wonderful.  love this place!	1
the best seattle has to offer. great pizza, great service good value and it was all i could do to stop myself from ordering a second pizza for desert. the crust is amazing, sausage as good or better than the best chicago has to offer. this is a top shelf place. we loved it.	0
awesomeness! food=great! try them sweet-tater fries!	0
the worst service ever!i had breakfast here about two weeks ago. it was a warm sunday and my significant other was craving french toast. ihop was packed. we came here thinking k2 would be it's usual, line outside the door. my breakfast partner ordered french toast with strawberries with two scrabbled eggs and bacon. the waitress walked away without asking to place my order. then when i waived her over to take my order her response was "oh, that's all for you?!?!" to my significant other. mind you my significant other is a grown man and that is a typical breakfast. i would order that and not finish my meal and i'm a fairly tiny girl. you think after that mistake, she would be on her toes, but no. it only went further downhill from there. her attitude from the beginning was as if she hated her job and didn't want to be there.she never returned to ask how our meal was or to freshen our beverages! again, this was two weeks ago. i'm still bothered by the awful experience, because i take my hard earned money for good food, ambiance and good service. i have told all my friends about this. i will never give this place a second chance, not only because of bad service, but the food was mediocre.alcove, home and k2 will be my go to sunday brunch places.	0
had the breakfast sandwich with avocado and it was excellent!	1
love sitting outside- the best iced tea! the service is good, they dont bother you too much. i try something new almost every time i go. granola with the strawberries and bananas is yummy!	1
wonderful live jazz at dinner. as someone over 60 it was great to be in a room filled with young working professionals that were kicking back on a friday after work but weren't the suit and heels crowd from the financial district. fun drinks, good food, attentive wait staff that tried very hard to help with special food allergy needs. pulled pork nachos were very good. rest of the food was good, not over the top wonderful. the food ran a close second to the feel of the place. it was loud but not in an intrusive way. could have stayed for hours. very upbeat vibe. nice evening out. looking forward to trying the bluegrass brunch.	1
i'd heard about this place before and decided to try it out while my girlfriend and i were visiting los angeles. it was an early friday afternoon and we were seated promptly on the patio, which i've heard is quite unusual. i went with the heuvos rancheros and the lady had eggs benedict. very enjoyable brunch and a great spot to people watch. service was also just as excellent.	1
this is my "go to" place! la cafe is around the corner from where i live and i literally go here about 3-4 times a week. i have never been disappointed with any of their food. i actually grabbed a few sandwiches from here a few weeks ago to use during a hike and picnic, and the sandwiches held up for an hour long hike. they have a great selection of food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and desserts/snacks to choose from. i only eat fish and seafood and there are plenty of options for me here.i also like that they are open 24 hours. after coming home from the club or late night outing i can always count on them to be open when no one else is.so definitely, if you are in dtla and looking for something to eat, stop by la cafe! :d	1
this place was a great surprise! the food was excellent. the service was good. i can't wait to come back. the macaroni and cheese was the best we ever had.	1
i love serious pie!!	1
the potato pancakes here are amazing. i have never eaten anything at canter's that was not delicious. even their burgers are good. they are usually pretty fast to seat and serve as well.my only complaint is they are really pricey. i have been to diner style restaurants my whole life and never paid as much as i do when i come here. yes, the food is great, but the price is a bit much.	1
hot? yeah, well, it's hunan food - isn't that part of the point? a buddy in vegas suggested i stop by dong ting spring after he overheard me complain that i hadn't had good hunan food in years - and he was absolutely correct. i had the smoked ham with dried turnip as well as an order of eggplant with long beans. the smoked ham was as good as i've ever had: high quality meat, plenty of it, with leeks and chilies like you wouldn't believe. the eggplant was super tasty as well with fresh, delicious long beans mixed in with another generous helping of chilies.  best of all are the staff: friendly, patient, and keen to make sure you enjoy your meal while making you feel welcome. the restaurant is spotlessly clean with an wide variety of dishes on the menu - it's shame i don't live in vegas because i'll never get to try everything they serve!  the only downside is the lack of a liquor license: iced water and hot tea are offered right up front, they do have some sodas, but alas no beer.	1
i hadnt been here in a few years, its still just as good as it used to be. cant go wrong. brought my date here after we caught a show, now she's a fan too... and its open 24 hrs... yay!!	1
soggy crab rolls and a generally tasteless meal. i also got the bahn xeo and tomato garlic rice. bill was $30 and change, extremely pricey for below mediocore food. first time having vietnamese food but this was a poor introduction that i won't let deter a 2nd try but somewhere else of course.	0
this place is by far one of my favorite rooftop lounges in dtla! the view is spectacular and the vibe is just chill and classy all around. if you get there before 9 pm, the line isn't as long but don't let a few people standing around single file scare you away. the line moves relatively quickly and the bouncer can have quite a sense of humor at times! reservations are key if you want a table and plan to order food otherwise you may end up waiting an hour or more (usually more) before you're seated (which is totally doable). in the mean time, go upstair or outdoors and grab a drink and toast to a fantastic night out in this wonderful town! there's usually a dj spinning great music inside and on occasion, you can catch a live number from a band as you gaze at the skyscrapers amidst the night sky. if you're looking to grab a drink, there's a bar outdoors too but be advised that they have a more limited drink menu relative to the one indoors. the my fair lady is a great signature drink to try. if you decide to grab something to eat, just know that the late night menu is slightly different than the dinner one. i've tried food from both menus (some of the items overlap) and i can say that everything that i've tried so far, has been good...the poutine is a must! bon appetite and cheers!	1
i have eaten at bottega louie a few times. the food is good and the service is good as well. however the management is terrible. do not ever try to plan a party or catering. i had a group of 20 i wanted to arrange a dinner for and after 3 emails and a phone call over 3 weeks i still never got an answer back. the email was read by several people including kevin mckellar, daniel flores, nicole tilley and a jschneider but not one person ever got back to me. i run a company that does a lot of event planning. this is the worst management i have ever experienced. apparently they do not need my business or the business of my clientele. i will go to cicada or roys or any one of the other fabulous restaurants downtown. i definitely will never recommend bottega louie for anything more than a coffee and pastry. what a disappointment in management. i will make sure i pass on my experience to my friends and clients. thanks for nothing bottega louie. looking at the other revues this is not a isolated incident and bottega louie while they advertise they can do a large group for dinner will not.	0
very good food. i had black beans with yellow-red rice, plantains, and chivo (goat meat) with onions and avocado. all for eight dollars. lunch special with a variety of meat options for $6.50 plus tax. the avocado is extra. i ate at the place which is small and has limited seating. service is good. people are nice. i would go again. i like good food at inexpensive prices. not fancy at all but service is good and food is even better. it's all about the food in my book.	1
amazing food and service. i absolutely love the carne asada fries!! i take all my girlfriends here all the time.	1
this is my first review with yelp, and i felt it was much needed after the horrible experience at this restaurant.   i should have known better than to stay and dine in a restaurant where the owner (juana herself) greets you and asks right away and are you visiting or eating?and  this given that with the exception of a family of 6 , this rather large restaurant was completely empty on a sunday at 8!  the place is nicely decorated and has a romantic feel to it, but it's not quite the same when the place is empty. the owner was nice and attempted to be our waitress. she quickly lost points with us when she first served a bottle of wine to a couple that arrived after my girlfriend and i, and even though we had already ordered our drinks before the other couple's arrival.   we ordered appetizers, which were ok. calamari was salty and greasy, and the owner came by, not to ask, but rather imply how good the calamari was ?!? i ordered a beef empanada, and that i must say was really good. for entrees, my girlfriend ordered the spaghetti carbonera, which was very flavorful. it was far better than at a lot of italian places i've previously ordered it at. i ordered the skirt steak, and it was probably one of the worst pieces of meat i've ever eaten. this $30 steak was loaded with fat, and far too thin. add to that a side of bland mash potatoes for an additional $6, and i had a highly disappointing $36 meal. juana came by once to ask our opinion, and i told her the steak had way too much fat on it. she took blame for it stating that she told her chef too leave extra fat on it for flavor. whatever... about 20 mins passed in between her asking our opinion on the food and the next visit from a bus boy. i requested the check, that took an additional 15 mins or so to be brought out. i didn't even bother to get dessert, and left highly disappointed and hungry!! juana did sit and the bar with a few friends enjoying her wine and thanking us as we walked out..   needless to say, this spot will never get another penny from me. it's a shame given that the place has potential, but the quality of food is very poor, especially for what they charge for entrees. there are far too many good restaurants in brickell to wanna visit this place ever again.	0
the burger was okay..... the french fries was just as good quality as costco french fries or some grocery stores frozen french fries.   quite honestly, i think in-n-out burger is better!!! the service is very awkward too, the server/owner/whoever he is doesn't really talk to you at all. he takes orders with no acknowledgement or response after you place your order and just serves you.   also, if you decide to come here, make sure to bring cash. it's cash only.	0
yum. great indian food on monroe st.	0
toast is absolutely incredible. the bread they start you off with is soft and tasty and is served with an amazing green dipping sauce. also, the main entrees are quite inexpensive for the enormous proportions they give you. i had a turkey club sandwich. it was delicious and more than filling. i went there for dinner one night and only waited about 5 minutes. the setting is also very cool. no booth style seating here. if you choose you can sit in the laid back couch area. this place is truly a must for anyone living in or visiting la.	1
it's been a loonnngg time since i've been here! came here for lunch and had it to-go as well. toast bakery cafe is a great little lunch spot but it's always packed! you can either park farther on the street or across at the structure for $6. if you like tomato basil soup, it's awesomely tasty here! highly recommended. the nicoise salad was light made me feel all kinds of healthy with the corn, green beans, etc. this time, i also tried every kind of cupcake they had, well except for coconut 'cause i don't like coconut. my favorite is the red velvet, carrot cake and chocolate. *red velvet: i know the word moist shouldn't be used but the cupcake itself was! the frosting had a really nice home made quality to it and it was slightly more tangy than sweet*carrot cake: this was just delicious all around. recommend!*chocolate: like the stuffed strawberry, the chocolate is velvety rich. a lot of their frosting is cream cheese-based like on the ones for the marble. it works for some but not so much for others. they had also green velvet as opposed to blue. interesting because the inside of the cupcake was so green. the artificialness looked kind of scary. their menu is so extensive that it's difficult to make a choice. i've skipped out on breakfast twice now, so i'll be back to try it out!	1
i'd give this place 2.5 stars if possible. tables excruciatingly close together, noise level tolerable, but because tables are so close it's hard not being distracted by other conversations, portions are teeny weeny and super pricey for pasta. additionally, our orders came in all kinds of crazy sporadic order. and for goodness sake, in a place called flour+ water, you have to ask for bread. come on...don't get the hype--been there, done with f+w.	0
pan sauteed snapper was like a cross between a heavily frizzled fried egg and a shoe insole. it was seasoned ok, but way too tough and dry. sides were unispired.	0
i've been a suviche fan since they opened their closet-sized fast service spot in brickell. happily, they have evolved into a strong full-service restaurant with three locations, of which this is their newest.  the ambiance is really lovely, with a high-ceiling patio complete with graffiti from local artists and giant comfy swings. the vegetation in front is medium-high, so the traffic is not bothersome.  always a consistent restaurant, suviche's food once again is on point. we had the special and eye doctorand  sushi, which had tempura shrimp, eel sauce, spicy mayo, avocado, and perhaps a few more yummy ingredients. it balanced extremely well and was quite a hit.  i had the special rocoto ceviche, which was deliciously spicy and acidic. ample fish were topped with crispy onions. just how it's supposed to be!   hubby and friend each got a ceviche they were equally happy with, and my bestie had the tuna huancaina (i think i have the name right there). her tuna dish was out of control! perfectly cooked, sushi sized pieces of cold yellow potato were topped with raw tuna, piled high.   while the food was all kinds of delicious, i'm sad to report that the pisco sours were disappointing. there was no egg white used, so the drink fell flat. it was pisco + sour mix, which does not a proper pisco sour make. as a restaurant billing itself as having a pisco bar, i certainly expected a stellar drink. it's possible there was some hiccup that caused this travesty, so i'm willing to give the pisco bar another shot. i'll be sure to ask some questions before i order next time though.  our service was definitely above average and friendly (thank you, jessica!)  also note there is a free private lot right behind the restaurant. score!  bottom line: stellar addition to the wynwood/midtown neighborhood offering well-priced fresh sushi and ceviche and great service in a quaint atmosphere.  ps - a little birdie told me they are going to start delivery soon.	1
food: ordered the spicy totto ramen and the mega ramen. i did not like the noodles. it was too soft. out of the two, i would go with the mega ramen. mega ramen is basically a pork lover's choice. however, the pork (not pork belly) was too dried. as a meat lover, i didn't even eat all the pork. the broth was standard and nothing special. it wasn't bad though. the spicy totto ramen was a tad spicy but nothing that burns your mouth. basically, spicy to them means crazy whole boat loads of black pepper. didn't really care for the broth.  ambiance: not that noisy. they have regular tables and tall tables.   service: ate pretty fast here since i had 30 min left on parking meter. nothing bad or good to note.  the bottom line: won't be back. i prefer to go next door to hide-chan.	0
the only thing worthy of this place is the ambiance being that it's great during cool weather. bathrooms are disgusting to the point where a couple would be considered out of order from the wretched stench and the service was probably just as bad with their attitude and how unprofessional they were starting from the outside bartender(s) to the security. what type of human being who works with the public throws a persons credit card and security throws objects to the customers. very low class people pretending to be in a high class environment. first and last time going to this place until they re-evaluate their staff on their behavior. i nor the party of 15 people i had that night have had such bad experience anywhere and i will make sure people are aware along with the promoters i know and any other entrepreneur(s) who want to visit this location. you're staff will degrade the business until a for sale sign is posted!  let's not forget if you complain, rather than correcting the problem(s) in hand you get back an idiotic comment from someone extremely immature because that's how business is done in their handbook.	0
wonderful spanish food and great service. its a mom and pop restaurant except this one is a mom and daughter buss. homemade and fresh..... i had the lenguado (fish ) grilled with asparagus and steamed potatoes! excellent! do not hesitate , its a must.	1
from start to finish, capital grille was excellent. reasonably priced choices for bottles of wine. superb food. they paid attention to the fact that we were celebrating a birthday ( without having to be reminded) and brought out a lovely congratulatory dessert to the table. a wonderful dining experience.	1
went there on saturday for lunch. we sat in the new area to the left. the place was empty but we were sat at this mini two-top in this awkward corner...	0
yum! pizza is always good but the caesar salad is absolutely amazing!!!! great dressing fresh greens and perfect croutons. so so so good!	1
just ok.  we had the fried chicken, prime rib sandwich n sweet potato raviolis. all were fine...nothing special.	1
i dined at golden temple about 10 years ago when i lived in brookline.  haven't been back since until last week and now i remembered why i didn't go back.  the service was extremely slow.  had to wait 30 minutes for a wait staff to come over to take our drink order.  every wait staffs that walked by our table just ignored us.  my husband finally had to walk over to get someone to the table.  and this was exactly what happened 10 years ago!  food was just ok.  there are a lot more chinese restaurants in the neighborhood with better food and much better service.  i will remember never to go back!	0
i tried the umami burger. it was soggy and it tasted...i don't know...weird. it's hard to describe. i feel like they decided to throw in every possible flavor without balancing them. the smell of the fried cheese on top was enough to make me gag a little bit. i had to force myself to choke down maybe two thirds of the burger so i wouldn't have to put my $11 to waste. just go to in-n-out.	0
the owner said he wanted this to be a place for the community but he opened the single most expensive cafe in the neighborhood thus ensuring that others will follow.   i understand the desire to make lots of money as quickly as possible but the prices are ridiculous. the coffee is around $3 for a really small cup (4 oz?) and no refills. we've come to expect coffee to be a minimum standard size. also, most of the beers are over $10 for 10 or 12 oz. if he was so intent on making this a 'place for the community', why not have a couple of more reasonable options.   don't even get me started on the fact that they don't have low fat or non-fat milk. the owner thinks that whole milk is healthier which one can debate, but seriously, one can argue that their gooey pastries made of refined white flour and sugar and not that healthy either. sometimes in trying too hard to be so hip and cutting edge comes across as being somewhat dictatorial. it's a cafe for eff's sake, give people options and let them decide.	0
i have been a regular at puerto viejo since it first opened, however, it is getting one star for the horrendous service i received on saturday evening.   i decided to have a group dinner with some girlfriends who aren't from brooklyn. upon arrival, i was greeted by the hostess and seated almost immediately. at first it was 5 of us, then our 6th friend joined us 10 minutes later. when she first came in, the waiter was haphazardly blocking the aisle and impeding anyone from coming into the restaurant. my friend politely said excuse me, and the waiter (i don't know his name because our receipt said leandro but the manager and hostess refused to give me his name) told my friend that she needed to wait until he finished conversing with a customer. after that, every time he passed our table he rolled his eyes at my friend. when it was time to take our orders, he handed out 5 waters (did not hand one to her) and did not even address her. because of this waiter's obnoxious behavior, she refused to order anything. but when the bill came, i noticed gratuity was included. i asked the waiter at what number is gratuity included, he told me that gratuity is added when there are 6 or more guests. when i asked him why was gratuity included when he hasn't even acknowledged my friend, he told me and i seated 6 guests.and  when we asked to speak the the manager, not only would he not get him for us but he said we can walk to the bar and ask for the manager ourselves. when we did that, he called over a woman and told us that she was the manager. after a brief convo with her, she admitted that she was just a dish washer and not in fact the manager. after all of that, we finally found the manager and had the gratuity removed (after a short argument). i will never come back to this restaurant again. i have frequented many restaurants in ny and have never experienced such rudeness and dishonesty in my life. save yourself the agita and dine elsewhere.	0
this place is pretty good. this place shares the lot with cafe concerto. parking is valet for $2 and do not mistake the entrance for something behind it! you enter through the ramp.ordered the bul dalk (spicy chicken) level 4. i wanted level 6 but the waitress discouraged me from getting it (i was a little annoyed by this, but she meant well (: ). so, level 4 was just okay spicy for me. i can definitely handle more. the order doesn't come with rice, so if you want rice then you should order it separately. however, you don't need rice to eat it. there is some crispy rice things under the chicken and it's sufficient.i will come back to try spicier levels! this place is pretty darn good	1
favorite items on the menu are...1. spicy cigars2. lamb swarma3. hummus4. lamb kefta5. sliders6. new for me forget what it's called (gaffet? - hot canoli type thing...)	1
so i have to say, my recent visit to this place was awesome! the fatty tuna (toro) was like buttery and delicious... and i gotta say, the spicy tuna is pretty yummy! i didn't think the lettuce would be good in this cut roll.. it made it taste refreshing! i would definitely go back.. nom nom nom!	1
i've only been coming here for dinner. the burgers are delicious and comes with a good portion of fries or salad. the waitstaff are accommodating, friendly, and patient. on my first visit, my friend and i were given green shots of an eclectic mixture of liqueurs from the mixologist who was getting experimental. i thought that was a nice welcome.  there's always a good amount of people in there to be busy, but not crowded. it's really nice to have another sit down restaurant that has a good variety of menu items that is now close by.   my most recent dinner here was light. i chose a market salad and the moroccan soup from the starters section. i can't believe i'm reviewing a salad, but for 5$, it came filled in a large bowl with a light and flavorful vinaigrette. i took my partially eaten soup to go.	1
nice atmosphere and our wine was crisp and light. i had the tenderloin and although i ordered medium it was very rare and i could barely eat it. my husband had a rib eye and it was tough and fatty. service was average but next time we opt for a steak will be going elsewhere.	0
this place is only opened a few weeks, they have a great selection of fresh juices especially the vampire juice. my food favorite so far are the beef empanadas, guacamole and steak with mushroom taco. my friend had a tostada and some kind of spicy pork and loved it. finally there is a decent place to get food in this neighborhood.	1
long lines for just so-so food. perhaps the high ratings are due to the nostalgia factor coupled with very few breakfast options on the hill.	0
i ate here for the first time today. i work in the area and was tired of trying the same places. the place was busy, but the service was great, friendly and timely. the food came out in a timely manner and everyone enjoyed!	1
i'd been driving by their cheery orange umbrella-patio on olympic for a while, now. i like the faux-retro decor. i'm not an arby's fan, so i won't compare, but this is a delicious, substantial roast beef sandwich. very tender, almost suspiciously so, but delicious. i got the "black and bleu," with fries, and even though i was ravenous, it was a fight to finish all of it. i did anyway, and i hate myself now. no, seriously--curly fries tasty, but eminently shareable; i can't imagine how filling the "dirty" fires or ones with toppings are. with normal hunger the sandwich alone would be plenty. will have to return for the frozen custard--absolutely no way it would've gone down after the sandwich and fries. counter staff cheerful and efficient. that is one noisy patio with grimy la brea whizzing by, but it was friendly and spotless. pricing excellent for the size and quality. bonus: they have one of those wacky soda machines that will add flavors in any bizarre combo. lime-vanilla-cherry ginger ale? yes, please!!	1
probably the best kept secret in madison. if you think you like mexican you haven't seen anything yet. go here and you'll never eat faux mexican (i.e. taco bell, chipotle, etc.) ever again. you can get a seat at the bar and watch them cook the food right in front of you with telemundo playing in the background. this place is authentic mexican food and the people are very nice. i am a fan of the sopes and their cow tongue is pretty tasty too.	0
someone at this establishment tried to use my credit card information fraudulently.   luckily chase caught it quickly and suspended the card.  normally i wouldn't post this because i have a hard time blaming the establishment for isolated actions of a rogue employee but this case was egregious.   i called to inform the owner that he might have a shady employee and i was hung up on.   so i called back and asked for the greeter's and owner's names and was ignored and told nobody was available.   i left my phone number and was called back almost immediately by a second person who denied anything i mentioned, sometimes before i wad halfway through a sentence.   so unfortunately for the owners i'm advising you to stay far, far away from this place.	0
i didn't know places like this existed in los angeles. i love the lemon tea, its perfect! the ambience is awesome; grass, picnic tables, little cubbies in the shrubs. i love coming here to destress. it's its own little oasis in the midst of downtown. blocking out all the traffic and riffraff. this place is definitely a gem!	1
i was underwhelmed by my birthday dinner at cut. the hostess was wonderful, the wine list was great but our server was an automaton who seemed slightly annoyed that i wasn't ready to order when he wanted me to order. that set the tone. my disappointment comes not totally from the service but from the food. i had the wagyu ribeye and it was almost inedible. the waiter explained that the meat would be prepared with a char-crust -- which i like a lot however, my crust would be best described as a salt crust. i tried my best but it was no good and in truth, i wasn't at all confident that if i sent it back there would be any difference. i also got the mushrooms and peppers -- big mistake as the green peppers completely overwhelmed the mushrooms. in fairness, my friend had the crab/shrimp louis starter and loved it! she also had a filet which was perfectly cooked. i had the butter lettuce salad and it was good as well. i expected so much more. i am in vegas often and was looking forward to this experience.	1
great little place for breakfast. i ordered the stuffed french toast and was very happy. i'm sort of partial to french toast at the mission in san diego but french toast here was great.	1
hey this place isn't 3 1/2 stars! i think its pretty good and i get the 17.99 one. they have a lot of extras i like such as do shi rak (kimchi fried rice w egg) that comes with the combo. meats not too bad either obviously it ain't kobe.. but its good. try it out.	1
the sausages are some of the best i've had, forget wurstkuche... unlike them these guys make them in house. the sides are killer, very fresh. amazing beer list. they were also playing a bunch of great 90s indie rock when i was there, so they get even extra points. one of my favorite new additions to the neighborhood.	1
a little taste help me quit my starbucks routine. great coffee and so so so good, creative pastries.	1
visiting miami and stopped at casa juan the food was delicious and everyone's review about big portions is correct. service was great too. i recommend to stop in and try thir surf and turf if u can't decide what to eat.	1
omg. i didn't know that fish tacos could taste that good. i felt like i was living out the fish taco scene in and i love you, man.and  these tacos were light, crunchy, and fun - a perfect symphony of flavors and textures.	1
went here on a wednesday. the happy hour includes $5 on most burgers! the burgers were a good size and tasty.  when walking on 1st look for a red colored gate and you'll go down an alley to get to the bar. you'll see table and lights strung up between the 2 buildings. there was a chalkboard sign that lead us to the way but be warned blink and you'll miss it.   they also have live music starting around 7pm except mondays.  if you are in little tokyo and need a watering hole, check this place out!	1
last winter, my husband and i went to saigon noodles to satisfy a pho craving and i would describe it as a good meal.... but being freezing cold, despite sitting at a table very far from the door. today, my husband and i had another craving and we were in the area so we ventured over to saigon noodles. i would not come back to this restaurant-the chicken skewers we ordered, which were around $6 were made of greasy chicken product (think nuggets) and came without any sauce and stale veggies on the side. our pho ga lacked any flavor and arrived cold....i also found a hair in my pho. the worse part of the meal was being literally frozen. i will admit that today was a particularly cold day, but the restaurant was filled with folks with their coats on. unfortunately, this restaurant is completely understaffed as well...the poor waitresses were running around like crazy and didn't come to the table except to take our order.	1
ridiculous! we sat down for 25 minutes before the waitress took our orders! they had 3 people waiting the room, what kind of arrangement in table service u called this!!!   wont come back for sure!	0
this is really good chinese food in the brookline area. there are not many quality chinese restaurants but this is very good.	1
consistently cooks a great steak wherever the location, capital grill in lv didn't disappoint with the steaks my friend and i were served the other night.   the only problem was the server.  while she was very nice, it has seemed liked she was not trained very well. didn't know any details about basic bar drinks nor several of the menu items and had to run back to the bar or kitchen several times for information.  and e en then, didn't get the info i asked for.   i can tell you that the servers in the philly capital grill know everything about all of the menu items and are well versed in all things bar.  i attribute the problem to poor training by management who needs to pay more attention to their training methods.   why the big deal?  because this makes a huge difference in the dining experience when you have top notch servers.	1
this is a wonderful addition to the community. there's always something going on here whether its live music or clothing drives. the cafe is eclectic with a great artist vibe. the spinach salad is a must!!! looking forward to future events. i'll be back for sure. i love that they offer board games and books, i spent 6 hours here!	1
everyone's right, their abalone porridge is really good. of course, i've been there twice and that's the only thing i've tried. i'm planning on giving their ginseng chicken soup a shot next time. but mind you, the abalone porridge isn't the most flavorful thing in the world, but it's damn comforting. especially since, coming from an asian family, i am away from home all summer, sometimes i just crave a big bowl of my mom's hot soothing porridge. this porridge hits the spot, and their complimentary side dishes go perfectly with it. mmmm...	1
how have i not been here before?! the entrance to the restaurant is unique and a little hard to find if it's your first time there. we went for sunday football and was hesitant that it would be packed, but surprisingly there was plenty of room and multiple t.v. screens that were playing different games. i ordered the far bar burger and it was more then what i expected! their wasabi fries are to die for but i'm sure everyone here has been raving about them so you already know! i will definitely be coming back but next time it will have to be during dinner time because of the lights outside on the patio. service is excellent as well!	1
restaurant setting for dinner matches connected eclectic kimpton hotel. nice tapas selection and good service. recommend.	1
bloody marys? spicy and delicious. brunch (blunch) ? killed it. the crab cake breakfast was so good that i'm not sure any breakfast will ever make me this happy again. the wait is long but totally worth it..	1
canter's is my go to for a corned beef and pastrami sandwhich. although, it doesn't always come out hot. their bakery is great though! rainbow cookies for life!	1
very good restaurant . great american breakfast wow and good quality. service niv e abd great decor. wanna country breakfast ir lu ch or dinner look no more hummm	1
after more than one visit to umami burger i'm prepared to give up that 4th star. since then i've been in smaller groups and that has dramatically improved the experience and the customer service.i've now tired not just the port and stilton but also the socal burger, truffle burger, manly burger and carnitas burger. i've literally never had a bad bite of burger here. the carnitas burger was different and good but i definitely prefer the regular burgers. the truffle burger in particular is awesome (as well as the manly burger). i'm very much interested in trying the earth burger and the greenbird. during my last meal here i also enjoyed some onion rings that basically made me super happy. i even dipped them in the weird umami ketchup that is sort of growing on me. when it's all said and done, umami is a good eats. the burgers are across the board awesome. after my moderate first experience i was hesitant to return but am so glad that i did. it's definitely a yummy time.	1
i thought this was going to be a great experience but i was wrong, the food was horrible and service was terrible. i brought a plus one and it was going well till the food came out. save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. trust me	0
i've tried almost every pastry in this shop and i've loved them all. as a bonus the woman who works the counter is the sweetest person i've dealt with in the food service industry. honest! go see for yourself!	1
i have been coming to this noodles and company for years and have been of many others.. this is still the best quality noodles, hands down. all clean, and the food always tastes like it was just made, not pre cooked like a lot of other noodles i've been to.	0
i love seafood! and korean style bbq seafood?!? even better!?! their portions are large and you definitely get bang for your buck. i've only sat outdoors in the balcony and prefer to sit there because the smell goes right up and outdoors where you could hear the cars on the street. it makes you feel like you're in korea at one of those "po-jang-ma-cha's.(tented street food bar) they even give out all these side dishes and pretty filling "appetizers" (an-joos) before the main dish comes out. so, either soju or beer is a plus!all their seafood comes out fresh, as if they just came out of the ocean. i couldn't ask for fresher head on shrimp, abalone, jumbo scallops, mussels, large clams, baby octopus, oysters and more clams! mmmm... just thinking about the hot charcoal firing up and cooking the seafood, with bubbly juices coming out as they cook from the sooty charcoal aroma!the only bad thing is that there are always a lot of people, so patience is a plus or go early, before the dinner crowd.* in favor of: absolutely all fresh ingredients, free appetizer (and portion!), fast service.* against: the long wait if you go during peak dinner hours.	1
i have been here numerous times and i have never ben let down. i am sad to see that gregg and keila left bad reviews for them. i have eaten french food all over the world and i dont think they deserve it unless the service was terrible. i ordered the steak frites and cheese and we all got carried away. the menu is good and the wine menu is quite extensive. i rarely go downtown to eat and this was a treat.	1
thai tom lost my business forever tonight. i'm battle hardened to their always terrible service but sitting at a table for an hour and a half without explanation and then receiving sub par food was too much to endure ever ever ever again. this will be irrelevant to them i am aware but i feel compelled to make a note to myself for future reference. not worth it!	0
mmmm... lola's.	1
second night here in a row. food great. staff service good. why is it spoilt by bus boy staff leaving you dirty cutlery after a course. this is the difference between outstanding service and not.	1
well i've been back a few times and i can now say i have figured out exactly what to order here. the guacamole and chips are the best i've had anywhere and i am a chips and guacamole aficionado. tonight i had the carne asada and i don't even like skirt steak so let me start by telling you that. it was so incredibly tender and flavorful i can't give it enough stars. i also dined here the other week and i had the scallops and they were delicious. i had the tamales and i thought they were just so so. the only problem with this place is it is noisy and there is no seat in the house you can find that isn't noisy. i guess the best thing is to just go early. i'm hoping that they eventually get some outside seating where you can at least in the summertime get away from all the noise. my server tonight was judy and she was absolutely fantastic and attentive. she was the one who suggested the carne asada and she was right on the money.	1
just had ramen there for dinner. i had the tonkotso ramen (added an egg). if i had to use one word to sum it up it would be salty. they must have used a ton of salt or msg to the point that i couldn't really taste any pork in the broth (maybe there was no pork). the egg was the worst. it tasted like it was marinated in regular soy sauce. yes. the marinade is supposed to contain soy sauce but not just soy sauce. if there were such a thing as solid soy sauce that must be what it would taste like.	0
great place, divey and with a great selection of cocktails very creative but one thing i have to bring up was the food. totally unexpected, starting with some very creative guacamoles and ceviches. from the hot kitchen you have to try the croquetas, melty and crispy, the arepas are great also. for the main course, you have to have to have to try the short ribs, good service over all and affordable!	1
we've been back at least 3 times and we always leave so happy. the food is delicious, the portions generous, the wine list offers variety and service is friendly and competent. we thoroughly enjoyed the arugula and cesar salads, the mussels were perfect, and the pappardelle with truffle burro was amazing, the zuppa di pesce also a perfect combination if seafood in a tasty, delicately spiced broth. a great meal!	1
it a hole in the wall! but thats were the best foods come from! the meats are fresh! and all meats our cooked onsite while your wait for your enormous sub!! my fav is the chicken terriyaki sub with all the trimmings.	1
the decor and ambiance are very nice but the service here is horrible. and the food is not that good. i tried to give this cafe one more chance after my first attempt where i was waited on by a man who was clearly an aspiring actor and this was his part-time job and he looked miserable. you could tell he hated waiting on me. every time i asked for more water, he looked at me like "really?". so last night i went again to give it another chance and the waiter was even more annoyed with the fact that he was a waiter and it got so bad that i wrote him a note on my receipt telling him how unwelcome he made me feel from the moment i walked in the door.	0
i know this is going to sound like a heap of self-loathing on my part, but the main reason for my distaste for genki ramen is that the food tastes korean. the ramen didn't have that milky, fatty, umami-laden goodness you'd expect from the real deal (even at the crummiest of the japanese-run restos you're bound to get a smidge of it) and the croquettes and katsu were undercrisped and a bit greasy. operational touches indicated korean nuances, like the filet used for the katsu that was on the thinner side (as koreans used to serve it before they caught on to using chop-size cuts like the js), which i actually prefer, but it just indicates to me that i'm having more of a fusion-y, interpretive experience. what saves this place for me is that they have decent happy hour offerings, and beers are actually quite affordable.if i happen to be mistaken and there is, in fact, no korean involved in the operation of this restaurant, then it is truly my mistake and for that i am sorry. but then again, if this is the case, this is a bunch of japanese people who just don't know how to make good japanese food. you tell me which is worse. it doesn't really make a difference for me, since i have bags of shin ramen-- what korea really does well.	0
simply put: the best burger i have ever had!i recently moved back to texas, and i am having major withdrawals (texas is the land of the burger, but i have found nothing that compares to umami burger)! if anyone is listening, please consider opening a restaurant in houston.	1
1.5 stars overall. i've been very disappointed with my last two visits here. still unbelievably crowded but, that is a side issue to what is driving my disappointment. the quality of the burger/cooking temperatures has had serious quality control issues. one time the burger was dangerously rare. i showed a worker passing by (you can't really get up from your seat to complain because your chair/space may be gone upon your return-yes, it is that busy). she sent a manager over, whom was very apologetic. she put in a new order to replace the burger, however, she got so busy, forgot to pick it up. it came after some prompting by me, 20 minutes later. she was, again, very apologetic but, i wasn't really hungry anymore.  last week, i gave ss another shot (i like fresh, non hormone treated burgers). i think it is my last visit at this location (but, may give the soon to be opened vegas location a try). this time my burger was so overdone, it was crispy (thus super dry). so, disappointing! even the shake was tasteless-and i've never had an issue with the ice cream quality previously.  fries still tasty. thus, the 1.5 stars.	0
our go to spot for sushi. they have fresh fish, good service, and awesome sushi shefs.the wait gets very long most of the time. make sure you get a number ticket when you walk in. the bar seating is usually faster so we sit there. perfect for a party of 2-4. when its less hectic we get table seating.we usually have our own set menu but we try new things almost once every time we go. consists of: toro sushi, salmon belly sushi, blue fin tuna sushi, albacore sushi w ponzu/chives, and a sashimi dinner. maybe include one hand roll (love the spicy scallop hand roll)love the salmon and can eat it all dayyyyy	1
while the farm to table trend is one that my palate truly appreciates and admires , this savvy restaurant is one that i would have to rate mediocre at best .	0
okay fine.  this place rubs me the wrong way - the service was way too impatient.  i tried to like you, i tried to try you, but you turned me away because and it wasn't convenient for youand  if i ordered some food before my friend could join me.  is that what this is all about? if i am convenient for you?   so somewhere in the time i spent waiting in the cold, hungry and desolate, looking inside at your empty tables, and seeing the rather dryish omelettes being laid out, i lost my appetite. i called my friend and we picked another spot.   someday, when it's and convenientand  for me maybe i will try you out.  otherwise, you're just not worth the wait.	0
fantastic cocktails, excellent food and very warm and friendly service. will go again and again.  did i mention the cocktails ?	1
this is definitely a place i will visit again. i had the lunch combo with the hakata ramen and salmon rice bowl and my ramen was dynamite! i especially like how the marinated eggs were soft boiled, which mixed in well with the ramen and the meat was super savory.   we also had the takoyaki and chicken and gyoza appetizers. the only thing i did not enjoy much was the gyozas. they were a bit small and a little bland compared to some other places i've been to.	1
the kitchen makes good food. but the wait-staff has a lot of trouble delivering it. that may be because there doesn't seem to be anyone in charge. mixed up and missed orders seemed to be the flavor of the moderately busy day i was there. in watching the staff perform, a few things seemed to be wrong, imo. one is that the barrista should not be bussing tables or anything else. that person should be responsible for putting drinks together with the meals and doing a final check on the order by looking at the oder ticket. this person should also be keeping an eye on where the various table ids are, so he/she can direct the waiter efficiently. i would go to trays instead of handling plates (fewer trips, fewer mixups). the dishwashers should bus the tables by doing a regular sweep of the ding area; a little cart would be handy. there should be an outdoor wait person and an indoor person. there should be one swing staff who can jump from station to station as needed. people don't want to wait 30 min for a sandwich. if word gets around that you shouldn't eat here, then precita park will become an ice-cream and coffee place, and the disorganized waitstaff won't have jobs. so, waiters, get organized or get your resumes ready.	0
came here for the second time on tues night before 4th of july and it was a horrible experience! because of this, i am dropping 4 starts to 2 stars. we were seated at the bar and we still had to wait at a minimum of 30 minutes to get our drinks each time. the bartenders were randomly choosing people; there was no particular order. also, there is a line to go to the rooftop! i waited for 20 minutes, people were leaving but they weren't letting anyone in! too much hype for perch. please go earlier in the night and choose a weekday if you want to check the place out!	0
hands down, best clam chowder i've ever had.. they have the new england and manhattan clam, salmon, corn, and specialty chowders... but they are known for their awesome clam chowder.. this is a great spot to come when its cold and rainy. it can get pretty crowded, you order inside and there are a couple spots to sit or you can sit outside and enjoy your soup. if you like bread, you can get your soup in a bread bowl or just order the sizes of cups you want. you will get a slice of bread and you can grab some oyster crackers.	0
i've heard from many people about how amazing the galbi-jjim is here. i came with high expectations.  we ordered the galbi-jjim and haemul pajun. while the taste was decent, halfway thru the meal i noticed a giant cockroach (full thumb size) crawling up the wall next to my friend. we notified the owner/waitress who proceeded to yell at the helpers in the back to do something. when nobody budged, i took it upon myself to kill the cockroach. no longer hungry, we asked for the check.  we received a and discount.and  all they discounted was the two sodas from our order. pretty sad discount, pretty sad service.  will not be coming back and will be telling everybody i encounter to stay the hell away from this place.	0
i had a turkey sandwich with lentil soup and water from this place. i usually go to the cheese course since i work on the building but i decided to give them a try. bad idea. i have had food poising for 2 days now and i know it was their food because that meal was the only thing i consumed that day other than bottled water. don't go here trust me i have been through hell, vomiting, with a huge headache and plus my husband called them to let them know of the incident and the manager did not even apologize, she was very argumentative and rude. will never go there again.	0
had to try this place after reading so many good reviews.  the food is on par with any chinese take out restaurant. i had the fried dumplings, and scallion pancakes. as someone had stated, the non fried dishes would have been the better choice.  we noticed that the hot sauce and condiments were very watered down, and stayed clear away from that. describing the place as dirty may be an understatement (does not effect how i rate the overall restaurant food experience). it ranks up there with joe shanghai in terms of sanitary upkeep.  the hole in the wall setting felt a lot like the tight spaces of gray's papaya. it serves the neighborhood well, where everyone can grab a quick bite at reasonable prices.  when ordering, come prepared with a little mandarin. and, yes i think the owners are just messing with you because they understand you perfectly fine when you say and chun yao bangand , and they repeat and one scallion pancakes.and   if you know the difference between good chinese food and average chinese food, this place is not something to die for. many yelpers may have been hoodwinked by the hand drawn noodle making process. (heck, subway restaurants bake all their bread on the premise. you won't see me giving them any extra stars for that.)	0
pretty solid. the blue crab taco was my favorite. i just wished the truffle fries had a bit more flavor to them.....but, i'll be back!	1
i like marination ma kai. they have great spam sliders, and the fries are good too. their menu is easy, the staff is friendly and the food is good.	1
i loves me some sa-bai thong. i might love it as much as i love vientiane palace, and that's saying something.	0
the bouncer we encountered here is a jerk.  we wanted stop by for a drink and he told us we weren't allowed in even for a quick drink.   one of our companions was pregnant and needed to use the restroom. he said and noand  and didn't care.  never going stop by for a drink ever because of this bouncer's and hollywoodand  attitude.	0
they would not accommodate my girlfriend's or my allergies. guy at counter cut me off and made a snide comment about me and probably being okand  when i asked if there was anything i was allergic to in their breakfast sandwich. refused to listen to a request for corn tortillas instead of bread for my gluten-free girlfriend. cut me off mid-question. said something about a small kitchen. after spending the night in the er two days ago for a severe allergic reaction, i have no patience for this sort of treatment.   ate a mediocre breakfast sandwich on a table that hadn't been cleaned for 2 parties.  this place disgusts me.	0
i had a great lunch food and services was truly 5 star	0
servers were very professional, the sea bass and desserts were great. compliments to the kitchen staff. food and overall service was well timed. gorgeous view. definitely a good place to take your partner	0
i don't like to give bad reviews because i know how much businesses rely on yelp. this place seemed heavy on the concept and light on the customer experience. the "flow" of the restaurant makes no sense. you stand in line to order, then find a table for them to serve you. all the water and things are back over by the door (not just past where you order) so you have to double back. its like they are trying to copy urth cafe (also slow) or native foods (same concept, much faster) but you don't have anyone to ask to find the water and to speak to if there is a problem with your food. i felt like i was interrupting someone else from their job to get answers to find basic things.	0
so i am actually changing my review, i used to rant and rave about this spot, they have good sandwiches the pizza is good too, but the service is horrible and non respncive, i ordered a sandwich they said the wait would be 30 min, after an hour i called and the guy was like so 10 more min, called back 20 min later and was like forget it i don't want the order anymore he was rude and all i can say is forget pasquale's, go to villa roma accross the street or better yet order domino's same quality better service.	0
a neighborhood surprise. we came here last minute and it was fantastic. the owner was accommodating and pointed us to the best dishes on the menu. carrot soup, croquetas, empanadas, grilled steak and chorizo that will make 2 hours seem like 20 minutes. give this les spot a try, you won't regret it.	1
i think i was addicted to this place for a while. the chicken was so terrific, crispy and savory. i may never go back to an american fried chicken place again. i even like the radishes that come with a meal, they're even better than fries.a note: watch for parking. the store is in a place with parking but every time i went to the place the parking lot was pretty full so you may need to park on the street, which means meters.	1
meh.	0
drinks are good on the rooftop bar. downstairs is a club at night/on weekends. but as usual in miami, poor snobby service ruins this place. or maybe its the rude snobby customers who frequent this place? or maybe its both?  maybe its the miami culture...? maybe the customers are rude and snobby so staff gets fed-up...? maybe they are used to tourists and transient people so they don't worry or care about good service...? maybe there is not enough competition in the miami/brickell area so they don't care...? maybe the population for whatever reason just doesn't know what good service and class is...?  nevertheless the mojitos are great upstairs and some of the bartenders are cool/nice. they also know how to make a martini (hard to find) and it is not too loud upstairs on some nights so you can actually have a nice drink and a conversation.	0
went to this place tonight and had been here before when it was chop suey so figured out we would try it out. came here with 8 other people and it was completely slow their was only 2 other small parties so we figured we would get our food and drinks quickly boy were we wrong! so first we order our drinks and they take 10-15 minutes to bring them and when we got our beer it was warm. we also had order food which was mac and cheese lollipops a burger and our friends had order some curry, clam chowder soup and sushi rolls. well ten minutes come by an our waitress tracie let's us know that they don't have mac and cheese or curry. so then we just wait for our burger and sushi rolls well 20 minutes pass by and still no food mind you we had already waited 20 minutes so it was basically a 40 minute wait just to get our burger and sushi rolls. so we ended up just canceling our food since all our friends had finish eating. well when we cancelled our food our waitress tracie decides she wants to argue with my friend and say "oh no it hasn't been more then ten minutes." when clearly it was longer some people that had arrived after us were already eating all their food so clearly it was longer then ten minutes. i do not!! recommend this place! if you decided to come make sure you don't get tracy as your waitress she was beyond rude and a horrible waitress!!!!	0
i don't know what it is about this place, but anyone that likes it is brain washed. after hearing about how amazing steve's pizza is from a couple of co-workers i decided to drag my husband down to north miami to try it. there was a bit of a line but nothing intolerable. once we placed our order and received our drinks we proceeded to sit down. i found the entire restaurant pretty dirty and at this point i began to lose my appetite. the pizza finally came out and it looked delicious so i started to feel better about eating. well it looked delicious but it wasn't. the pizza is so disgustingly greasy. the sauce was really sweet for my taste but i suppose others might like it that way. we managed to only get through 2 slices and brought the rest home. for about 2 days after i felt like i had drank a bottle of oil and it was just sitting at the back of my throat. reheating the pizza made it even more greasy. i will never eat at steve's pizza again.	0
okay food, prices and portions but the service is awful.  the first time i went, the restaurant was full. instead of telling us to please wait, the staff completely ignored us, leaving us at the door. when we spoke up to ask how long it'll take, a server cut us off mid-sentence and then...went back to ignoring us. we were being extremely polite, just asking how long we would have to wait, but he angrily snapped at us, as though we did something wrong. it was beyond rude. we were actually shocked by the service, so we just left.   we went back the second time thinking the first time was a fluke but, once again, we were ignored. it wasn't until a little bit later when we were finally seated. the food took forever (30min for 2 entrees--and on this afternoon there weren't many people). when it came time for the check, i saw the european girls and family to my left and right ask for their check and have it delivered to their table. so, i requested mine as well. three times to the same person! i never got my check and had to go to the front to pay. i don't know if they expect me to pay at the front because that's asian style, and i'm chinese, but, if so, it was a little upsetting that i was treated differently. the man i asked for the check from could have also told me the second time i asked instead of agreeing to bring the check each time, then not bringing it. i was left waiting at my table confused as to what to do when the servers promised to bring the bill but never came.   i won't come again because, although the food is good, i can find food just as good food at places nearby with much better service.	0
came here on a chilly wednesday night as i heard it had just opened in the area and was eager to check it out. i'm glad i did.  the craft cocktails were unbelievable... really interesting flavors and colors made with unique ingredients. definitely gives all of the classic nyc mixology places a run for their money.  the food is latin american with a twist... we had the guac (must-order), the montaditos, the empanada, sliders, and the flan.... everything was incredible and the presentation was spectacular.  would strongly suggest you grab a table here before the word gets out!	1
i've eaten at the grove a few times now, and while everyone else seems to love this place, the only thing i like about it are the large opening windows. the food is not interesting and not good. prime example: they don't shred the cheese for their grilled cheese sandwiches. having attended a class on grilled cheese seminar by american cheese expert laura werlin, i know that a good grilled cheese sandwich is made by shredding the cheese so that it melts perfectly. the grove failed at this and my sandwich was very sub-par. the soups and salads have also not been great.so, if you're in the area and want a place to sit by a nice big window with a drink, go to the grove. if you want food, go elsewhere.	0
all i had was the pepperoni pizza here which was sooooo delicious! i definitely need to come back and try some other stuff.	1
the food is pretty good, but service is slow and its a bit overpriced for what you get really	1
unfortunately, we realized when the next customers were seated that the service was not up to par. we were never told the lunch specials  or offered a refill of our bread...like the table next to us. but we are aware that one of the waitresses is looking at an apartment, moves all the time, takes the bus now, and won't mind taking the train. the loud conversation of the wait staff filled the empty resturant and overpowered our tables conversation.  we were looking forward to some great italian dishes, however, my husbands pasta was undercooked. come on...it's pasta! my risotto was wonderful, but the pork shank literally had 4 bites of meat on it. i realize it was resturant week special but quality/quantity should not be compromised. we visited two more italian restaurants in the north end over the weekend and i must say the food and service blew this experience away.	0
in all of my 34+ years of dining in los angeles, this place has the hands down worst customer service i have ever experienced. all of the negative reviews below are 100% spot on, so there is no reason to repeat what has already been well documented. but i would like to add that in addition to the horrific customer service, ineffective / non-existent management and poorly prepared food, this restaurant is so negligent in their practices and care of customers that they have even failed at elementary items such as providing soap and paper towels in the restroom. this is beyond disgusting and completely unacceptable. i called in excess of 10 times to discuss the above, as i usually do not take the time to write reviews, but despite being promised numerous times that an owner or manager will return my call, no attempt was ever made.	0
awful service! my server was clueless. it wasn't even busy yet it took him 15 mins to come to our table. then he never once came back to check in. i was there for brunch. my sister's eggs were like rubber and my fruit plate had so much fresh mint on it that i couldn't taste the fruit. i really wanted to like this place but it's never going to happen. worst place i have been to in a long time.	0
forgot to update this. the problem mentioned was addressed, i've since been back many many times and never had an issue.will be a customer as long as i live in la!	1
crowded hipster "gastropub." christ, doesn't hollywood have enough of these? beer was uninteresting and served up in plastic cups (is this a thing now? really?). had some kind of bacon cheeseburger onion ring thing: nothing to write home about. was good: not great, not bad, not memorable, not interesting. fries were the same. dump all you want on fries: they're still fries. if you want to see bearded 30 and 40-somethings with band t-shirts drinking "craft beer" with their sig. others and offspring in an atmosphere that's one part high school cafeteria, two parts why-the-hell-did-i-come-here, this is the place for you.	0
wonderful pizza - even the crust had amazing flavor! prova also has a simple, modern environment. however, hopefully you enjoy your neighbors. they'll be close.	1
love. excellent pizza, chicken (so tender and buttery), and of course the bread. you must try their bread pudding for dessert. just do it.	1
the price and service would not have been an issue in overall ranking if the food was better quality	0
best, freshest soups and salads in madison. a great place to dine for lunch if you have the patience to wait for a table. the food is always outstanding, however the restaurant can be busy and noisy (cement everywhere).	0
picked perch for dinner after a tradeshow. we had 8:30 reservations on a thursday. the place was busy but not packed. our table was waiting for us when we arrived. i made the reservation through open table and requested to be sat outside to enjoy their famous views. our table was just barely outside. next time i will ask to be seated near the fireplace. we had the pork belly appetizer, two glasses of pinot noir, steak frites, scallops and chocolate custard. bill came to $125. our server was helpful and allowed us to take our time. being 34 i thought the place might be crawling with 20 somethings. it was a nice surprise to find a mixed crowd. the staff made me feel comfortable even though i wasn't wearing my 5 in cfm shoes! i can't wait to go back again for sunday brunch with the girls.	1
hand-formed pizzas were delicious. we shared a margherita (more basil per favore) and a sorrento pizza. never had prosciutto on pizza but it's salty flavor mixed with the sweet of the fresh tomato sauce was like a tarantella for the mouth!	1
i expected more from toast based on the yelp reviews and great location. i ordered a mediocre omelette and tea, and was, obviously, disappointed.the service was fast and friendly with nice outdoor seating, but the meal itself was "blah". great restaurant for people watching though!	0
surprised dad for lunch and took him for a burger and fries. he mentioned it was alright, at best. the bun got soggy quick and the burger fell apart so it got hard to eat. can't say if i would ever go back or not, ok not! second star goes to the nice family that owns it but foods just not that good.	0
good burgers, i like the thicker fries they didn't have them but never a bad choice.	1
thanks yelp! you came through for us and we were not disappointed with our spontaneous choice for thai tonight! we ordered panang curry chicken(amazing!) coconut soup(more coconut flavor than expected..in a good way), and thai doughnuts all delicious. thai doughnuts not as fat and fluffy as others i've had...think more like flat pillows than fluffy clouds; but it still satisfied my sweet tooth! :) family owned place and very friendly. we had never been here before but will definitely be returning to try more of the menu. like others have already said, it's a hole in the wall and not much atmosphere, but the food is great and we ordered take out so....bypass the atmosphere and enjoy your take out!	1
where else can you go to satisfy your craving for ramen and burger after 9 pm on a sunday night, but here! no traffic, no hassle parking and california donuts is just around the corner--perfect for dessert. the thought of blending my two loves, ramen and burgers, is a match made in food heaven. i tried the original ramen and the spicy burgers. i'm not a fan of spicy so i prefer the original ramen which was delicious!	1
i am serious about this. i lived in los angeles 24 years ago. moved back to my native portland, or (currently the little foodie-darling capital of the world) and never thought i'd ever be in la again this life time. however, here i am, unexpectedly -- on business -- and i am visiting all of my old food haunts. basic bare bones truth: canter's simply r o c k s !!! anybody who comes into canters and complains, or leaves less than 4 stars, is clueless. my review will probably not make it past the yelp editors, and so be it. truth is truth. if you dis canters, you are a clueless moron. thank you.	1
i ordered a chicken fried rice and seafood soup and noodle as a delivery. my bf got it and told me about taste. fried rice was just okay but soupandnoodle was delicious. :d i'll try other one too next time.	1
when toast first opened, there was a rumor among us nyc ex-pats that it was being run by the same delicious hands that brought us our beloved magnolia bakery. that this was ever true seems more and more dubious a claim. true, there are cupcakes to be bought that *look* a lot like magnolia's, but a single bite tells you these are either magnolia's 2-day-old leftovers, that much worse for the wear of shipping, or just crap la imitations. beside the disappointing cupcakes, there's a whole dining experience just waiting to bum you out. from the throngs of clueless hipster clones driving wait times into the stratosphere, to the often rude service, to the overpriced diner food that will, eventually, reach your table. save yourself the time and frustration. the long line here is in no way an indication of desirability.	0
absolutely outstanding!  service and food top notch. since we already knew about the family style portions, having been to the one in ny, the waiter did not need to explain. 5 stars!	1
ordered the bratwurst, they served it to me raw on the inside, as in cold and uncooked. waiting the next 12 hours to see if i'm going to get any food poisoning. i would avoid this place at all costs!	0
had some great fried chicken and fish and chips (my favorite...possibly of all time?). beware though: the portions are huge. the fried chicken dinner could easily feed two people, imo.	1
note* this place is categorized as a lounge and not as a restaurant- the food service reflects this. great ambiance and good drinks redeem the 4th star	1
one word... cockroaches.	0
overly priced cafe/diner items that are flavorless and colorless. so bland and extremely disappointing.	0
i will never go there ever again...!!!!service was okay.!! but the food is literally disgusting... i don't mind paying a high price but they need a new cook for sure.!!only thing was good chicken soup, that's all... rest is garbage....	0
a friend of mine recommended me this place after we went shopping at saks. i am glad i listened to her. i had a shrimp roll and it was delicious, the shrimp was delicious and fresh. i had the offer that goes with chips and soda, because they had some sort of whole foods type of sodas and i usually never drink soda anyway but they had something with lemon and lime. it was a nice and light dinner. get ready to pay $10 for a snaky time of dinner. upscale sea hot dog!	1
this place is brand new, but i can tell it will be around for a very long time.  everyone is very committed to detail and quality. not something you normally get at a and hamburger jointand .  the food is really good, it's clean, service is quick and everyone is very friendly.  i'm sure i'll become a regular whenever i'm in downtown miami	1
a relatively small bar that gets super busy. it can be a bit hard finding a seat, so watch closely for someone to leave and sit down before anyone has a chance to get there!the bartenders are very laid-back and efficient. sybil was our bartender that night and we eventually just asked her to give us shots of whatever she felt like making. she did a good job getting two of my friends drunk and gave us glasses of water (and kept refilling!) to keep them hydrated. drinks are strong for a good price. definitely want to try the flaming lamborghini one day, but i don't want to lose my eyebrows ;)wasabi fries.. were okay. i liked the fries. not a fan of wasabi. you can try to find parking on the streets or just park in the structure nearby.	1
my sister and i were very impressed with our lunch at strada. the wait staff was friendly and professional, the food was absolutely delicious, and it's lovely to sit out on commodore with a view of the gorgeous cruz building and the grove bustling around you. and for the outstanding quality of the dining experience the prices are quite reasonable.  they take food seriously at strada - we ordered a range of items - freshly made pasta, a grilled sandwich, and mushroom risotto. every dish we got was beautifully presented and exhibited well balanced, subtle, fresh flavors. this is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in the grove.	1
if you could have sex with katrina bowden, then take that experience and turn it into a burger you could shove into your mouth, then that would be the truffle burger at umami. after eating it i became very upset with other burger places for slacking, to the point where i ordered another burger, walked into jack n the box, threw it at the chef and told them to get their sh*t together. make a commercial about that.	1
this was quite a busy place tonight! usually, if you have to wait for a seat in a restaurant then you must know it's good. so we totally didn't mind waiting a bit for our table of 5 tonight.overall, the sushi, food, and service was good!	1
we had delicious dinner at the grill room! thank you very much adam for a great service!	1
i really wanted to like this place because it's walking distance from my house. but the food is just so mediocre and bland. and it's all about the breadand  on melrose is infinitely better. i've eaten here three times to insure they were not having an off day and i'm baffled by the ratings.	0
we went for a quick lunch after custom ordering a new bentley gt! we sat at the bar- waitstaff very attentive and efficient. friendly fellow at the raw bar. i ordered a dozen oysters and a few other appetizers. save for the oysters the rest of the food was a greasy mess. i have yet to walk out of this restaurant not feeling yucky. sadly, i had to make a quick pharmacy run for some alka-seltzer. i won't give this place another chance. ack!	0
modern and clean ambiance, nice menu and fair prices. service was smooth and prompty without bothering. great option for a casual business or personal dinner. probably not as impressive as other alternatives in the region but definitely provides a pleasant and distinguished impression.	1
i got very bad food poisoning from here and made me sick for 3 days making me not able to eat anymore in miami and sick on the entire 12 hour drive back home. none of my friends got sick, so maybe i was the unlucky one, but i won't be going back. so i'd take it with caution if you eat here.	0
we used to order delivery and take-out from these guys all the time...like, embarrassingly all. they make some good pizzas (dante's revenge and midnight in the garden) - kind of a thick, doughy pizza experience which isn't my fave, but creative and tasty. that said, wow they are jerks! one night our pizza arrived and it was...raw. as in, uncooked dough, literally cold, raw dough in the center. yuck. i called and nicely said the pizza was and undercookedand . the guy i spoke to (who seemed to be a manager or even owner of some kind) was incredibly rude. not once did he even sayand sorryand  or and we want to make this rightand ..what he said was and i will send another pizza if you can prove (yes he said prove) that you didn't eat the first one, and give that one back to us.and  excuse me? you think i ate your disgusting, cold-in-the-center, stuck-to-its-box, pillsbury doughboy on a bad day crust pizza and called just to scam some more? or that i want to keep the pizza, just for kicks or because it's suitable for framing? of course you can have it back. but don't start by blaming the customer. i didn't get an apology from the dude who delivered the marginally less soggy replacement, either, and they did take the bad pizza. i bet purgatory reheated it and delivered it to someone else. we haven't ordered since. at least they are aptly named.	0
worst experience ever. keep going. just keep walking. kitchen nightmare. no drink refills. we kept ordering things and then after plenty of time to make the item - we find out they don't offer it anymore.   happy hour? nope. brunch? nope. half the menu? nope. sushi? nope.	0
simply put, their tacos are bad.	0
food is okay.  more so than the food, place is great for date night. tree in the middle of the outside patio of the restaurant= why not? very intimate. location is a little hard to find (as most of the restaurants in silver lake area.	1
used to love the mayo-free tuna sandwhich, however, just got food poisining from the grove on 3/31/11. that is the only thing i had that day, so it was definitely from the grove. to top things off, the person i had lunch with there, also got food posining. so there's some serious sanitation issues going on behind the scenes. beware!!	0
came here on a random day and tried the 39. i'll be back here again very soon. the employees were polite and very quick with the order. my friend ordered the chilli cheese combo and he wasn't to satisfied. it's ok, not the greatest in the world but alright.	0
great food great service. nearly perfect meal and service . will be back	1
umami burger has to be my favorite burger joint ever. the truffle burger is a meaty cheesie perfection and their buns are always sooo fluffie and toastie mmm!!! i also recommend the hatch and cali burger. add some thin fries with your order and your good to go!!!	1
awesome place for a casual dinner. the only reason i don't give them 5 stars is that they have a communal table, which i am not personally a fan of. but we had our own table on a monday night and the food was delicious. perhaps the only disappointment (and it was mild at best) was the salmon cakes, which were more cake than salmon, but that is personal preference. the vanilla roasted beets were delicious. the steak frites and short ribs (on the seasonal menu in july) were both really delicious, and my husband would go back for the parmesan truffle fries alone. if this place had a full bar and was in walking distance of my house, i would be on a first name basis with everyone. i already know at least 5 menu items i want to go back and try.	1
i came here on a sat night for their grand opening, which i heard about through some friends. i came expecting an ordinary grilled cheese and was quite impressed to find that it's much more than your typical salty and greasy comfort food. pulled pork grilled cheese was perfectly crispy on the outside while the cheese was melted just right. i also loved that the pork wasn't overpowering. another dish i tried was some type of tater tots with fried egg on top. o.m.g. that's all i gotta say. i'm definitely taking my friends to try this next time.  oh, and i wasn't surprised to learn that the chefs who run the place are classically trained aiming to make some comfort food with 5 - star skills.	1
very tasty, healthy and decently priced. i like most items on their menu. definitely recommend!	1
my fellow yelpers! i reviewed a place back in august of 2013 called matt's at the market downtown seattle on the third floor of a building on the corner of 1st and pike st. well, i also mentioned a sister restaurant called radiator whiskey which is actually a cocktail bar on steroids just across the hall from matt's and owned by the same proprietor dan bugge. very cool! dan purchased matt's about eight years ago and kept the original name. radiator whiskey is his new creation that opened on april 17th, 2012 with a very unique style in gourmet eats. radiator whiskey has embraced a company called 2bar spirits, a local distillery just south of seattle, to create a house whiskey that is available at different stages of maturity. radiator typically carries fifty bourbons, twenty ryes, ten irish whiskeys, fifty single malt scotches and a variety of everything else you would normally find in a bar including wine and beer. wow!	1
we were showing a friend from out of town the linq and have heard exciting things about the brooklyn bowl and wanted to check it out.  we were promptly greeted and showed up stairs to the hostess.  there was a little confusion in seating us, and after walking through the dining area, we were turned around and seated at a booth we had already passed.  after sitting for more than 10 minutes without any acknowledgement by any one (the hostess passed the table twice) we took our friend to another restaurant in the area where we were well served.	0
perch is a fun place for hanging out and getting a few drinks around downtown la. my friends and i arrived around 11 pm on a saturday night, and thankfully, we didn't really have that long a line to wait on. the guys checking people's ids were very immature, though, but that's a slight hiccup. you go up two different elevators to get to perch, and once we were inside i was reminded of another rooftop bar i've been to in minneapolis (yes, that minneapolis): classic yet trendy decor (with lots of birds, of course), moody lighting, a lovely buzz from all the patrons, with the added bonus of a dj and a drummer on one corner. drinks are around what i expected; spent $25 for three drinks, one of which was ginger ale. everyone wanted to be outside, and we were lucky enough to grab a couple of chairs and create a makeshift seating area by the glass barriers. we had a gorgeous view of the financial district, and it was just warm enough, but you could also sit by the outdoor fireplace if you'd like. just a lovely place to hang and catch up with friends. oh, and i especially liked my mojito; mr. bartender did it right with the perfect blend of everything.	1
much better than last time with new manager new menu items. the asparagus tempura didn't work but the hanger steak sure did.	1
i had dinner here the other night. we walked right in - no reservation. it took forever to get our food due to some miscommunication with the kitchen. this was difficult to swallow, but they tried to make it right with numerous apologies and a free order of deviled eggs which was nice.   i had a biscuit sandwich with fried green tomato and shrimp and fried okra on the side. it was very good. my friend had a chicken pot pie. she really liked it. i had a nice glass (or two) of lambrusco.   would love to return.	1
great bar food! they have a great karaoke night and its a fun atmosphere! so happy this bar is in the palms area.	1
i literally wanted everything on the menu!  monica the owner is super cool and treated us like we were family/close friends. intimate/romantic setting with a divey twist. i'll be back to try more things on the menu :)	1
botero was incredible. elegant ambience, exceptional service, delicious food and great wine selection.	1
i used to walk to this cart when i worked on madison avenue - it is so yum! hmm, i might even make it a stop this summer. it's worth the walk!   anyway, here's a couple of easy-to-follow tips:  1. go early (or much later). the closer you go to peak lunch time (noon!), the longer that line will be. i suggest heading over there early - or going after the lunch rush.  2. know what you want. they move fast here.. so stuttering over whether you want extra tzatziki or not ... or deciding if you want a pita or a platter.. generally gets you some dirty looks from other people on line. have what you want to order in mind and shout it out when it's your turn.  3. get lots of napkins. oh, the gyro is deliciously messy so be prepared!  otherwise, enjoy! :]	1
love the fact that didn't have to wait long and it was packed! the food was yummy and waitress was exceptional.	1
i have been to 909 on several occasions and i love the fresh pastries they serve. the coffee is good the service and the neighborhood feel all make it worth going to. i have also been there for wine and was very well attended too...	1
dosas were good most other food was disappointing. not bad just not special. i had a chicken dish marked as a specialty that was the most uninteresting bland food i've ever had. no heat at all even though it was supposed to be 4 stars.	0
went for brunch here. out $15 plus tax and tip (cool $20) for coffee and a piece of toast with one poached egg, asparagus, and bacon on top. it tasted decent, but i think i've had appetizers with more food than that.  decor and atmosphere is nice and peaceful. i would go here for just coffee if the owners were cool with it, but brunch really isn't worth it. for $20, i'll go elsewhere.	0
my wife and i left dinner at nojo extremely disappointed. i really wanted to like this place because they have a good idea, a descent location and i like their fresh and seasonal ingredients approach from local suppliers. the problem is with the execution. i can't remember the last time i had such a bland meal. we ordered seven different items and somewhat enjoyed only two of them, and only one of those two would i consider re-ordering.salad: chicories, cauliflower, lemon-soy vinaigrette and shaved katsuo bushi - very bitter tastechicken breast on a stick and chicken thigh on a stick - bland with no seasoningtsukune: ground chicken with egg yolk soy sauce - okay, but not greatchawanmushi - bland with poor texture. the very small piece of crab tasted like crab but the rest of the dish had no flavortempura of vegetables - delicious and the only thing i could recommend orderingwhite miso glazed trout - well cooked piece of fish but, again, lacking any sort of seasoningi don't remember what the last dish we had was, but it was basically rice served in a bowl of water. it was supposedly green tea infused but i could not pick up any flavor other than white rice.i am hoping that other people have good experiences here and that the restaurant makes improvements because i want to see them do well, but i can not under good conscience recommend nojo to anyone.	0
first time here! satisfied customer. i will come back here again! healthy choice and fun to make your own spring roll! we made a good choice today. 5 stars!	1
i felt like i was in my own batman returns movie. where i'm having fine dining with the love of my life (who is batman), with the view of gotham city (eerie yet romanitc), on top of a building.and then someone tries to kidnap me so batman flies down the balcony (where the outdoor restaurant is) and saves the day while i continue to eat my skirt steak w/ cocktail in hand.yeahhh... that was my experience. you'll feel like you aren't in downtown la, or even in california....i loved this place.	1
great service	1
i had a great experience here. we were seated right away, service was great. we order the prime rib and kobe beef. it was delicious! the portions are a little small but you have to expect that with a french restaurant. i enjoyed the ambiance and the character of the place. i'd recommend this place for lunch, early dinner.	1
not bad, just uneven. on three visits it was all over the place - some excellent crudo, some eh, same goes for pasta.	0
fraudulent charges. 2 pounds of brisket at 25 dollars a pound. nice try. your bs prices are now put up for public to view. credit card disputing charges.   watch what they charge you and don't be intimidated. they are liars and cheats, that is guaranteed.	0
you can never go wrong with 4.99 steak and eggs!  only con was when i asked for egg whites only and they charged me an extra dollar. i can't complain though, it's just a dollar. buttt i could've played slots with that dollar hahahha   ricardo was a sweetheart and besides the extremely long wait for food (which should be expected due to the large volume of drunks coming in for cheap food), it was a great experience! steak was chewier than my likings but still.. 4.99 steak and eggs! cant complain!	1
love the happy hour, food and atmosphere.  however, be very careful with the wait staff on taking turns serving your table - especially the chick from valencia, spain.  you order a couple of $5 wines during happy hour, and wind up having to pay half a dozen on your tab. no kidding, this happened to me tonight.   and the worst part about it is that you must pay the tab complete with cocktails you never ordered or enjoyed. the swindle? and we'll review the cameras tomorrow and get back to you on how many drinks you ordered.and   believe it. nuts. so - my advice to you is to make sure to write down on a cocktail napkin whenever they serve you a drink (in other words, keep your own tab) and make sure to tell this waitress whenever she brings you a cocktail what your number count is - so you are on the same page.  otherwise, you will be paying a hefty bar tab and wait for the reimbursement to come later on, which will never come.  shame on you balans. i know times are hard, but i thought you were classier than this.	0
the worst service ever. food is so-so. a very much village style. and they include 15% gratuity be default. void them. don't get fooled.	0
we had one of my best friends grandmas 90th birthday here with a large group and they treated us amazingly! they set up a special area just for us and catered to our every need. truly amazing the special menu they created for us was perfect with a variety of options for everyone. food was great! i was impressed how they were able to cook so much amazing food for our large party and each plate was perfectly put together. at the end, the chef came out to wish grandma a happy birthday! definitely will be back!	1
friendly service, clean environment. took 23 minutes for me to get a latte. coffee was just okay...	0
i live across the street. awesome authentic food and love love the salsa they put on the tacos/fries. potato taco and carne asada fries are my fav!	1
this place has an awesome location and view, but the food needs major improvement. the omelette and homefries i had were way underseasoned and overcooked. the food here is cheap and quick to come out to the table, but there are better breakfast places out there.	0
$40 family style meal that consisted of bread and more bread in a room that was not air conditioned so you are sweaty and uncomfortable the whole time. i could have possibly overlooked the heat if this was an off day that the ac was broken, but i see from earlier reviews from other yelpers that they obviously don't care about the comfort of their patrons because this has been an ongoing issue for at least a month now. and seeing how hot it was, they provided water with no ice, we had to ask for a glass of ice every time. bad ac aside, the food was no better, the meal started off ok and just kept getting worse and worse.  they serve a basket of bread to go with the bruschetta appetizer, this will be an ongoing theme for the rest of the meal.  2oz fresh burrata - i'm a fan of burrata but this was one of the bad ones. first it was a measely 2 oz they provided for four people to share, i'm not sure where the $40 of the meal was coming from, but it's def not from the half ounce i had. it was not creamy, more like water and came with champagne grapes, not sure what those were for either, probably just for decoration because they added nothing to the dish. (grapes will be a returning theme for this meal)  za'atar and sumac lebni - the menu said pecornio in this, but i didn't see or taste any of that. i'm not sure how to describe this dish, it was an herby/spice like topping for the bread. the flavors were actually good and came with a cooling yogurt cream on the side too.  jerk style chicken liver - did not taste the and jerkand  seasoning or flavor, actually my first thought was that it tasted like a mcdonald's chicken nugget. the batter was a little thick for me and not evenly coated at all. some bites i had was all chicken liver and no batter, and others was all batter. this was on a bed of greens with pickled red onions (another running theme in the meal)  my favorite items from the meal were the salads.  caesar brussel sprouts - finely shredded and with a lot of pecornio, not too heavy on the anchovy or garlic though. although my fellow diners kept saying and would have been better with baconand .   charred gem lettuce - the description said coriander leaf dressing, feta and watermelon. what we got looked more like a caesar salad. i thought gem lettuce was the bib lettuce, what we got looked more like plain romaine. and no watermelon, instead had pickled yellow beets and pickled red onions (again). i didn't mind the taste of this but it was not what was promised/advertised per their menu.  baco - they brought out this platter of meats and the fava fritters for our table of 9. it did not look like a lot of food, meat wise it did not, but they give out these warm flat breads (more bread) for you to make sandwiches with, along with a set of four dipping sauces. the dipping sauces were meh to me. there was a chipotle mayo one, a salsa, a chimichurri which i've had better and can make better, and another sauce that i couldn't identify (because no one bothered to tell us, just plopped the food in front and left) but it wasn't that tasty to me anyways so i didn't care to find out. on to the baco meats! the fried pork belly was nothing special. i've had better at hole in the wall places. the braised beef was also fried, it was crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside, too bad not much flavor. worst was the fava fritters. i don't know what the hype is about these, they are just balls of fried mushed up fava beans. again the description said there was cheese in it, but i didn't taste any of that. everyone was slathering the mayo sauce on their baco because that was the only way to make it decently palatable. the bread was also too heavy, you can see from my picture i had a plate full of uneaten bread at the end of my meal.  mixed coca - another dish that did not come out as described on the menu and of course more bread! these are basically flat bread pizzas. the tomato and cheese said it had smoked jalapeno and basil, definitely did not taste any jalapeno, they must have substituted it with the pickled red onion (yes again!) that was on there and a sprig of dill.  the cream of mushroom one was better, it had a good amount of cheese and mushroom and the and sauceand  was a blended puree of mushrooms which was different. it lacked salt though or something to highlight all the flavors.   meal ended with dessert which the menu said seasonal fruit crumble w semifredo. i was looking forward to this since sweating the entire meal for some frozen cold dessert. first no semifreddo, just whipped cream and it was a bowl of peach cobbler with basic crumble topping, too bad it was so undercooked the inside was a mush of hot peach and undercooked flour paste. we complained about this dessert since it was so badly prepared and they brought out two other desserts as consolation, flan and a banana and salted caramel with whipped cream, both of these were much better, but still couldn't salvage the overall bad meal.	0
i love the smoked salmon sandwich.cool place...great atmosphere. everything here is so good.casual and chic in really france style!!!	1
this place was love at first sight. from the interior design to the drink menu to the guy behind the counter, oh yes, it was love.i want to fold this place up and move it closer to where i live so i can come here every day and fall in love with it over and over. i want to have photo shoots in the interior, start an art gallery in the well-lit center of the room and perhaps have a party here because the look is sleek yet still industrial. as for the menu, balance tea, where would i be without you? unbalanced, that's for sure. it's a tart blend of black, mint, and fruity teas-- each sip was perfect, no sugar-bath necessary. after oohing-and-aahing at the decor, the barista had me tongue-tied. somehow i missed the 'mingling with boys' lesson during my four years at an all-girls high school, so i still can't get it together when i am greeted by a cute guy-- especially those with accents. he may have just been taking my order, but in my head, we were in love. paper or plastik, you have a lady killer in your arsenal of baristas, wield with care or you'll have clueless idiots like me talking in gibberish when we're just trying to order tea. it doesn't matter that my boyfriend took me here. it doesn't matter that he knew i'd love it. the only thing that matters is that i've fallen in love with a coffee/teashop. you'll know what i mean after you listen to landon pigg's falling in love at a coffeeshop for reference: . sigh.	1
it was my first time so i got the taste of maine. the lobster roll was definitely the highlight of the meal. the shrimp and crab rolls were just ok and the crab had small pieces of shell in it. next time i will stick to the lobster. i recommend getting it as a meal. the kettle chips are actually crispy and not hard! so hard to find good kettle chips these days. i also tried the blueberry soda (yay) and the ginger brew (nay).	1
we come to vegas every year for the nfr. benihanas is our favorite place because of the food, personalities of staff (especially the chefs), atmosphere and locale. we always share a table with others and it is great!! we shared a table with 12 people from portugal on monday night and we had a blast! our chef, kevin, made the night. even though they couldn't understand him, he made them laugh. our food was excellent. he made sure we were taken care of. i always recommend benihanas to everyone i know. keep up the great work! i will be back in january for national home builder show, see you then!!!	1
cold food, slow service, incomplete orders even when the restaurant is full and doubled its size. not as good as it was.	0
crappy service. decent drink selection, but we were the forgotten table so it didn't matter. cool location in a dark alley between asian restaurants. ordered food, 20 minutes later told that it was 86'd. other item we ordered was also out. over it by then, time to go to wurstkuche instead.	0
i waited outside for 45 minutes to sit at the bar. the food took another 20 minutes. i gave my other half some kisses on the cheek while waiting patiently. when my breakfast arrived which included scrambled eggs to my surprised they threw in some egg shells with my order. no. really. there were egg shell pieces in my scrambled eggs. when i went to pay the lady at the counter made remarks about how i gave a show at the counter with my other half? um. maybe i have some remarks about the time i spent waiting for everything and eating egg shells.	0
great little family place. food great freashly made at time of order. it does take longer definately don't go if in hurry. place is small might gave to wait for table. but worth it	1
priced on the high side for what you get! needs more seating!!!! food is good but again pricey especially if you would like to go at least 2 or 3 times a month.	1
both my experiences here were pleasant and i really like the way my french vanilla latte is prepared.	1
outstanding...! this is how gelato should taste.	1
the quiche is silky and custard-y and not dense. sooooooo delicious! everything else is amazing too!	1
atrocious customer service and crap food. not worth it.the first time i went i had the french toast. it was awful and bland. the second time i went with a large group. we came in separate cars .. and didn't all arrive at the same time. i walked in after some of my friends had already been seated and the hostess started yelling at me. she was upset that i was only one person when my friends had told her there were three more joining the table. the lady wouldn't even let me by to join my party until i'd explained three times that my party was already seated. the place wasn't very busy.. it was pretty late and during the week.. but the hostess refused to let us sit at a larger table until the rest of our party arrived. instead, we had to pull up a chair to the booth.. getting in the way of the servers. after less than five minutes of waiting, the hostess came over and insisted that we order. she chided us saying that "this is a business .. we can't have people sitting and not ordering."we left right away and went to fred 62s on vermont where they were happy to serve us.	0
for the adventurous eater. this had been on my list for a long time, and i attempted to go there twice before finally being able to get in on my third try with an old coworker who was in town for the week. people love this restaurant, so we were very excited to check it out. unfortunately, we were completely underwhelmed by everything we ordered (which were the most popular items on the menu - salt-roasted beets w/whipped goat cheese; milk braised pork shoulder; and pig's ear w/crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg). every dish we tried was ridiculously salty to the point where you couldn't taste much else. maybe they were having an off night? either way, very disappointing.	0
if you're gonna have anything here, you have to have the patacones. they are life changing! service is fast and thankfully the staff speaks english too.	1
you don't get a menu, which is odd.  food salty and average at best. way to pricey for cheap pasta. mussels tasted like water and garlic	0
fantastic selection of sausage! fantastic selection of beer! it's a must. i can't wait to get back to try more. i hear the pretzels are also amazing.	1
on a beautiful seattle day in may, i decided to check this place out because it made sense to have chowder in seattle. i'm so glad that i came here!	1
i used to come here a lot, and though the food is good, they screw up the order about fifty percent of the time. i pay for things i don't get and i'm so tired of it. so from now on all of my business will go elsewhere. putting things in a bag shouldn't be this hard.	0
#60 is for far bar. i love this place. came here with my bf to celebrate his friends birthday. we all had a great time. the food, service and beer selection are amazing. great spot in little tokyo. will def be back.	1
this place used to be a guilty pleasure of mine because it's not exactly the healthiest, but oh so addicting and good. well, i can't say that it's so yummy anymore after going with my friend the other week. we went during dinner time on a rainy day when it wasn't that crowded yet. in my history of coming here, the service hasn't ever been really good. you have to constantly ask the servers for things or remind them to bring what you had just asked for. anyways, on to the food... so before when i used to come i would share a large order of the chicken wings with the original garlic sauce. a lot of times we would come when we were starving so we would split the 50 or 100 piece order. but now they don't have those large order options on the menu anymore. also, they would usually throw in extra pieces for the larger orders because i don't think they would count that accurately. now there is just the exact amount. my friend and i split a 20 piece order, and there were exactly 20 pieces. my friend had the kyochon in korea and was craving it, but she was a little disappointed that the taste, although decent, was not as good as the original in korea. this time around, the pieces didn't have the same crispness that they used to. the other thing that i was disappointed about was that the order doesn't come with salad anymore. i actually liked their eccentric salad with fruit pieces, like strawberries, and their version of ranch. it was good to have salad to offset the sodium-filled artery clogging chicken. but no more, the salad is extra. the end of the meal somewhat redeemed itself with the arrival of the green tea yogurt in the little plastic serving dish. like the rest of korean yogurt places, this was good yogurt, but it still didn't make up for all the other shortcomings. i'm leaving for korea this week, so i'll have to report back about the real kyochon there.	0
amazing new bar with amazing bartenders and amazing management. a very welcomed new addition to the neighborhood.	1
only local chinesse in this place, so i figured it would be good. it was. pork in a light flavorful chicken broth for $3. green onions and another slightly bitter veggie i could not id. excellent.	1
called to see if they were open on easter day and the girl on the phone tells me in a condescending tone and normal hours we close at...and  i hung up the phone . stupid! i don't want to hear about your normal hours or whatever. i want to know what time you close today on easter sunday. is that normal? ah hahahah	0
the service was outstanding...... the main course was ok but the desert was great	0
it's never a good sign when you leave a restaurant hungry after spending $60+ for two people. maybe you're supposed to spend more money on more food? for that much money, we could have gone to other places in greenpoint and stuffed ourselves silly with equally good food.  ordered the chicken dish and got 4 pieces of chicken in the bowl. think what would happen if you cut up a chicken finger into four pieces. that's how small of a portion of chicken you get. also had the rice with yogurt, hen of the woods and toasted nuts.   food was good, overall, but definitely not worth the price for the tiny amount of food you are served.	0
wanted to love this place based on reviews but this place nor food comes near a five star.   firstly, waiting one hour in line to place an order is unacceptable. secondly, to get attitude from the meat cutter for asking a question n cashier to direct his frustration because he does not have change is even more unacceptable after such a long wait.   guy running around w his daughter, who seemed to be the owner/manager? was quite sympathetic n nice as he apologized for credit card machine being down n later gave us siracha wings. btw, line was molasses slow before machine went down.   now down to the food...  let us just say that if it were not for the bbq sauce bottles on each table, the meat does not taste like bbq at all. between all of us, we ordered brisket, pulled pork, spare rib, mac n cheese, cole slaw and corn bread.   our rating:  brisket 3 stars, pink so undercooked and not flavorful...no seasoning taste at all.  pulled pork 2 stars, no bbq taste, alot of fat n skin slab taste. huge dissapointment.  spare rib 1 star, barely cooked raw n pink n no flavor n dry.  mac n cheese 1 star as cheese n pasta tasted like two entities while it should have fused together, also cheese not melted enough.   cole slaw 1 star, very basic.   corn bread 5 stars hence why place should be called hometown cornbread and not bbq.  girl serving sides, owner and male waiter this past saturday were all very nice, all others blah. place is nicely designed but food and service does not represent the high money cost.  do not fret though as you will not be dissapointed nor wait a ridiculous time at butcher bar in astoria. you will close your eyes when you bite into their bbq meat especially the pulled pork.	0
over one hour for the main plate to arrive after the appetizers and only about 1/2 of the place was full. the food was between mediocre (the pasta overcooked, the rice was mashed) and bad (the chicken was horrible, the nikkei cebiche was sweet, not cebiche-like). the waiters are nice, but inefficient, not once did they refresh our water or even ask how the meal was. for $50/person (no drinks) i would expect much more.	0
there is something so simple and clean tasting about thee hickory burger. i've been coming here for years. this is my favorite hamburger spot in la.its not all flashy like all the burger joints popping up every where. it's just a simple burger done right every time.	1
i wanted to like this place. i wanted to really like this place. especially with all the mediocre reviews.but, i don't.it's a waste of time and money. the fresh shrimp rolls were..too chewy.the pork meatballs were...too small. the duck was...dry and tasted waaaaaaaaay too bacon-y. it was gross. we sent it back.the good? the $16 wine, the tofu dish, and the green beans. yum, but still not worth the price...sad day. and just 1 block from me :(	0
we got crab cakes to start off. i wouldn't recommend these. they reminded me of something fried you might get at a fast food restaurants. however, the steak frites made up for everything. it was cooked exactly how i like it, and it tasted really great.   the waiter was friendly and on hand when we needed. the manager was also very nice.	1
i was so excited to try this place! it looks popular from the crowds outside, and read some good review on yelp. i brought my whole family here tonight for dinner.my mom walks with a cane, and was asked by the hostess if she could get down the stairs. we all replied, "yes, she can". she asked more than 3 more times, and by this time my mom was already halfway down the stairs. i'm not sure what about "yes" was not understood.after we were seated, the nicely dressed wait staff came to take our order, at which time i spotted an approximately 2.5" roach crawling above us on the ceiling. i pointed it out to the waiter, and he motioned for someone to come over. that person scooped it up with a napkin, and it fell on the floor. not sure what they did with it from then. not the most appetizing first impression.we ordered the salt/pepper fried crab. it was "ok". not worth $40. we also had scallops, "special beef" and honey walnut prawns. nothing struck as spectacular.the main dining room is in the basement. probably not the best situation for a restaurant in chinatown.i think one visit is enough for me. it was an adventure, though.	0
this is a fabulous new greek restaurant. the soup was the best chicken rice in las vegas. also the best saganaki i've had in this town. the mousaka salad and then baklava all excellent. a definite must if you ever thought you like greek food.	1
come for drinks and view not overpriced food. this is a really cool spot, lots to look at from the creepy wall art to the outdoor patio with a bombass view of pershing square. not to mention the treck through 2 elevators to get up to the restaurant/bar area.drinks a bit on the pricier side. ~$12 for a mixed cocktail.	1
our family had a great get-together at benihana.  the food was fabulous, and the experience was entertaining.	1
just another rave review here. there is no parking, but the burgers still make it five stars from me.   and, the seating is just stools at a counter, very close together. usually with a wait.   takes me back to the 40s and 50s.   my favorite is the hickory burger, with the sauce on the side.	1
i really enjoyed our dining experience here. we went for a sunday early dinner(~5pm), so we got to be sitted right away.	1
this is sad... i saw sign of food violation sticker on door. it was close.	0
this is a neighborhood spot. everyone is welcome and you definitely feel that way when walk in. the staff are friendly and they love food. michael's beard and enthusiasm for good eats makes it hard to leave after eating any meal there. try everything on he menu, it's worth it and you won't be sorry!	1
the food was really good! tasted fresh and flavorful. me and my boyfriend tried some new dishes and enjoyed our meal. they had many vegetarian options for me and a lot of meat choices for my boyfriend. we only paid $26 for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert!! really good prices and big menu. server was very nice and helpful. she asked a few times if we had any questions about the food (as some of the words were bulgarian) and she explained the dishes well. definitely will be back and will be bringing friends.	1
i've been here 2x so far and like it a lot. they are relatively new so i hope they maintain their good quality food and service. food was good. i've only tried their pasta marinara with chicken and it's good.	1
the staff is extremely friendly. a friend dragged me here because he wanted to grab some smoothie at 5 am... i didn't order anything, but the staff saw that i was waiting for my friends drink and kindly gave me a bakery treat just for waiting. far drive, but it's totally worth it if you're craving treats, drinks, or a sandwich. the bakery i must say, is extremely sweet to the point you will have a higher chance of getting a cavity. but it is good, however, it's to sweet for my taste buds.	1
i eat here from time to time, and i keep coming back for 1 reason alone... consistency! every single time i have been to siam bistro the food is good. i've had a bunch of different things on the menu, and never a bad one. if you are in the area, it's worth checking out.	1
found this place on yelp, i have never reviewed a place before and had to sign up for an account to review. i had the honduran carne assada, it was prefect, the plantain was ripe, sweet and perfectly prepared. this is like getting real central american street food than fancy but perfect. we had guacamole that was obviously prepared after we ordered it, very fresh. my friend had a burrito that was delicious.	0
seriously, giving this place four stars is like giving mcdonald's four stars... sure i was born in pittsburgh but living in miami, there are way better places to get cuban food. even cuban food fast! as they like to advertise. they don't have limes! what kind of cuban sandwich couldn't use a nice squeeze of lime? that's like going for sushi and the restaurant not having soy sauce. if you're the kind of person that thinks burger king or mcdonald's sells awesome hamburgers, than you're going like this place. it's exceedingly generic and unoriginal. however, if you're longing for something more authentic, keep moving... i've had better cuban sandwiches from the mom-and-pop columbian places in kendall, which is just sad for a bunch of and cuban guysand 	0
so disappointed. we showed up for dinner last night and because of broken water pipes were unable to be seated. the restaurant said they would give us a call if things opened. no phone call. no follow up. just a canceled reservation. we called dell'anima (sister restaurant) who could not accomodate us either due to the spillover effect from l'artusi. the restaurant did not make any attempt to truly apologize or offer us future reservations (or a glass of wine at the bar!!!!). truly sad to say that though i have heard great things, my experience with this family of restaurants was very poor.	0
weak crust. doesn't anyone in seattle make baguette with a decent crust? macrina certainly doesn't.	0
cant get any better than this. i stopped by before work and let me tell you, best dogs i've ever tasted. can also serve as a great hangover killer ;) much recommended!	1
my prime rib and baked potato was luke warm.  my wife's steak was  over cooked.  she ordered med rare and was given med well.  finally, both of our veggies were very salty.	1
beautiful restaurant with a very large, but intimate outdoor dining area surrounded by trees. you can't even see or hear sunset blvd! the brussel sprouts were the best i have ever had. they were crispy and were topped with balsamic vinegar and sliced almonds. i tried the flat iron steak which consisted of two huge/thick cuts of steak. it was very tender and flavorful. i tried a little of the pork, that too was very good, but i prefer the steak.	1
damn i really wanted to like this place too...the first time i drove by and saw the old 'pasquale' sign on the corner of 9th and irving, i instantly had a one of those "this has to be some authentic italian pizza" feelings. i vowed i would love this place no matter what it tasted like.so filled with high expectations, i tried it. hmph.the sauce is pretty good, the pepperonis are sliced pretty thin, the crust ends up a little hard-- it ain't that bad of a pie, but at the same time it really isn't all that special. the staff here seems pretty friendly, and the menu looks pretty big. i'm sure i'll come back here again to try another pizza, or maybe some veal-- but for right now it's just a-ok	0
very enjoyable evening with my wife. food was exceptional and reasonably priced given the quality proper preparation and attentive service.	1
i love the greenbird with shelton farms turkey, crushed avocado, green cheese, butter lettuce, sprouts, and a green goddess sauce.the hard cider was strong, but great with any burger and side of truffle cheese fries.	1
outstanding food. loved the biscuit very much. best i've had in 11211 since goods shut down. the buttermilk dressing is exactly like my grandmother used to make. delightful. can't wait to go again.	1
not impressed -- everything was a notch below average.	0
mediocre mexican food, with sub mediocre service.  this was pretty straightforward: we were ordering our drinks and an appetizer. you go away, then you come back and take our entree order. you don't disappear for half an hour. i had damn near finished my beer before i even got to order my dinner. no refills while we waited, either. that waiter was one disappearing act.  we'd come in hoping for a quick meal. no such luck.	0
good but not worth the price.	1
i really enjoy coming to this restaurant for more than one reason. one, the food... having been there several times, i have tried the short ribs which are excellent, sea bass which is absolutely delicious, lobster mac and cheese, the tuna, the popcorn shrimp (i have no idea how anyone can talk bad about it) and the salad with the quinoa which i am obsessed with. the desserts i've tried are the churros, cotton candy and the "flower pots" which is a banana crumble and a chocolate crumble. honestly i cannot say anything bad about any of it and would recommend them all depending on what one is in the mood for.second, presentation... all appetizers, meals and desserts are presented in a very fun and interesting way and definitely not something you will find elsewhere. other tables are always looking at the tables next to them to see what their presentation is. third, service... immaculate! everyone is so pleasant and attentive and really provide excellent service. the manager is amazing and so pleasant and personable with the patrons. makes you feel at home and wanting to come back.the place is loud since there's music playing and it's usually crowded but it has never interfered with conversations. i definitely recommend this place for the reasons stated and also because overall it's fun and trendy restaurant.	1
awesome new spot in bayridge. outdoor patio is great, might need some more heaters as the weather gets cooler. beer selection is on point. food options seemed good, waffle fries were amazing!  definitely will continue to check this place out and hope the beer selection changes often!	1
their food is good but way too oily. i want my vegan food to be on the healthier side and this is anything but. yes, they have good stuff but there's definitely better vegan in nyc. if they cut back on the oil it would be significantly better but i personally don't enjoy ordering a seitan sandwich and having to use 10 napkins to pat it down.	0
it does not even deserve one star! over priced drinks, rude bar tenders, ordered a dirty martini was mostly olive juice. don't waste your time with this place!	0
well worth the price, the chicken in my ramen was very juicy. tasted a lot like toto ramen but didn't have the one hour wait.	1
was absolutely over the moon when this place arrived in my neighborhood. happy hour selections are outstanding, the dinners are perfectly portioned and the ambiance at night is super sexy.	0
get the curry bowl with brown rice and thank me later.	1
tripas tacos were too salty. asked for pineapple on tacos and they still forgot. i've been here before and i was impressed. but not this time. they really need to set up a better strategy for ordering the food. i would recommend that you order and pay in the cashier and wait for your order to get called. simple right?	0
holy moly. get the bacon wrapped dates !!!lamb and black cod also very good here. will definitely be going back! recommend reservations at least 1 hour ahead on weekends, to save waiting !	1
i'm very disappointed that they forgot again my ingredients. no vinegar, oil, peppers, onions. this is the 2nd time it's happened and it's been both places on sahara. this was my favorite sandwich shop but it's looking like not anymore.	0
came all the way to brooklyn to try out this restaurant that was featured by anthony bourdain and eddie huang. we tried many dishes and i can say they were all pretty disappointing. portions were so small for the price. papaya salad was subpar. i would say the pork belly dish was good but menu listed it came with pork shoulder. no pork shoulder in dish... desserts were extremely disappointing, especially the pumpkin tapioca cake with sticky rice. why was the sticky rice soooo salty?? and the pumpkin tapioca was so unbelievably hard. i expected it to be smooth and soft. quite disappointed. extra star for the nice ambience.	0
it's not really good. it's more of a tradition.	0
so many great sauces for the flavorful chicken strips dont leave without the smoked tomato soup!!	1
came here on a friday night and the atmosphere is definitely cool and unique. started out w a bunch of craft cocktails that were all simple but very well put together. the crab cake is the best appetizer our group ordered but the fried shrimp were huuuge. now on to my favorite part of the night: the fried chicken. it was juicer, crispier and seasoned better than any fried chicken i've had in this city. i'll definitely be coming back.	1
not the best but far from the worst. i'd rather eat at nate and al's in beverly hills, or brave a trip to langer's, but canter's is open 24-7, which is handy at 4am when you're anywhere near the fairfax district and feel like a corned beef sandwich on rye with dressing and coleslaw.  i've only had a fraction of what's on the huge menu; it's sensory overload, but i have a feeling that only a fraction of what's on the menu is really, really good: chicken soup, towering sandwiches, the lox plate, jewish deli things like that, but when east of la brea, canter's is definitely one of my go-to places.  is it kosher? i don't know. i've seen orthodox jews intheir black suits all over these parts, but never inside canter's.  that said, the sandwiches here are big (and on the expensive side). the menu might say and hotand  corned beef or pastrami, but the meat comes sandwiched to you sort of warmish. it might bother you, if you're that type but there's enough for two or three normal sandwichs in one canter's brooklyn avenue. also, at times, the crust on the rye can be a little unforgiving to tender mouths, so take some care.  the chicken broth is pretty good, i guess. it's better than campbell's and tastes like the perfect remedy for a cold. i also like the heartier soups, particularly the barley bean soup, and the split pea (if i'm ever there on a wednesday). the huge bowls come with some bagel chips, some of them sturdy enough to break a crown, but not totally impervious to soup.  there are also half sandwich/soup cup combos that are very nice and won't put you under a food coma.  there are entrees on the back of the menu that come either ala carte, or as a full meal with bread and butter, a starter like their big bowls of soup, and a simple dessert. i've only had their brisket, but that's because of my weakness for potato pancakes.   i've had the corned beef and cabbage. not bad, but don't be surprised if there's half a head of boiled cabbage underneath that seemingly huge pile of deli sliced corned beef.   i've also had their big serving of short ribs, suitable for sharing, which are on the bland side, but tender as ever.  once, a tablemate ordered a salad that looked like it was supposed to feed a family.  there's a huge deli case in front and also a bakery section, of which i've never been a huge fan.  toilets for the main dining room are upstairs, making it sort of a trek after a big meal, but it's almost the same effort to walk to the back dining room, adjacent to the noisy lounge area, for the first floor restroom.  their parking lot is nearby, at the fairfax/oakwood intersection, and it validates. there's also another smaller lot across that can handle a bit of overflow, but with both lots full, you might have a better chance winning the lottery that finding street parking.   fyi, more often than not, a homeless person stationed between the bright restaurant entrance and your parked ride gets you coming and going.  the service can be salty, depending on who's assigned to your section, but i wouldn't say it's intolerable; this place, transplanted from boyle heights a faint lifetime ago, is an l.a. landmark. it's nice to go just to say you've been there.	1
great neighborhood serving restaurant. valet available right in front. me and sister had the special for the night: a tomato based squid ink pasta with seafood. deelish! and not fishy tasting at all. split the arugula salad and the baked polenta to start. overall a great experience. didn't have a reservation and they seated us relatively right away even though it was a friday night. will definitely be back!	1
this is another one of those places that has stayed constant in my life since i first set my foot in la. and another place where i used to go for hangover, and now i go to cure my morning sickness instead. they are always in the same place, always open whenever i go, and always have the same food that i can predict. the abalone porridge and the samgyetang are still good, but another soup that helps me now is the seaweed soup. (loved it so much that now i am considering coming here for my birthday soup on my birthday.. yeah only a korean would understand what the heck i am talking about.) and of course, their jangjorim is still as warm and yummy as they can be (and as my hubby put it, free beef side dish as much as you want it) please, never go away. i love you guys.	1
the food is good, the place is cool looking, the vibe of service is off tho. it should be like a diner vibe, like johnny rockets or something. the girls are quiet. i like the food tho, just think it has potential to be a neighborhood spot.	1
great food and ambience! finaly! a restaurant that the music was not a live concert at the arena. music was actualy nice....food took a little time, but was still good. i recommend!	1
this place is the bomb real cool and nice inside. the staff and the 3 owners are really friendly and down to earth. and the veggies are nice and fresh awesome salads. i came here twice and had awesome customer experience. oh! and get some coconut water with your salad taste soon good!	1
this place is perfect! let's just say if they had one around where i live i would be there every day! little place with amazing taste and ambiance.   i had the chicken chaufa (if that's how you spell it) with quinoa. they had two sizes, regular and large. now, i'm someone who can eat a lot but today i thought i should take it easy and get the smaller one so i got the regular. i'm sitting in my car writing this review and i am full! the regular size was perfect!  all in all, this place is amazing and i wish they had one in broward! also, claim the two free cookies cause they are on point!	1
saw a cockroach and the manager just sad sorry and still brought a bill for 70$	0
come on there over 400 reviews. no one cares what i have to say.	1
the only fast food chain i eat at. just ask servers to put on new gloves and you are set for a gluten free meal. check the taco del mar website for which items are gluten-free before you go. staff is wonderful too!	1
awesome food!	1
i have been coming to this red robins location since they opened their doors. while i've always liked there burgers and ice cold beers lately the service had gone down hill. the last 3 times i have visited this place the food takes about 45 minutes to arrive. the refills never seem to show up and forget about getting an types of sauces upon your request. i can understand if your short handed or what ever the case be. over the last 3 visits over the last 6 months it's gotten worse. they had no utensils or glass cups. they gave us plastic forks/knives and cardboard cups. needless to say i will never be coming back to this red robins and since this seems to be the only one in miami red robins period.	0
good and service was subpar - cool atmosphere but don't come here to eat or drink they can't even make a proper martini and it took asking 4 people to get my jacket hung up it also took a hour to get the check -honestly we won't be going back and def stay away from the fried mac and cheese balls they were flavorless	0
my husband and i usually go to danicos, but decided to try this restaurant because it had a higher rating on yelp. big mistake, service is nice, but the food is twice as expensive and incredibly bland. if you want good italian, head to danicos!	0
yes the strawberry fields are good, but the service and friendliness of staff is horrible.	0
went here last night for the 2nd time and loved it even more than the 1st!	1
if i'm in little tokyo, i'm hitting up far bar. everytime i've been, it's been perfect-- not overly crowded, attentive staff, good music, and non-pretentious clientele. there's something fantastic about going somewhere so hidden and mysterious!	1
i had heard good things, but can't echo them myself.the chef's tasting menu was primarily a spread of the appetizers. for a chef's tasting menu, i'd expect maybe half the courses to come directly from the menu. a couple were good, the rest average, none were bad. the drinks were a wash, i enjoyed mine, my date did not enjoy hers.we had no less than 4 different servers, which made for an incoherent experience with each asking the same questions. that doesn't count the clearing staff.the final server forgot to add the meals to the bill and then apologized when i pointed it out. it's a nit, but i'd expect a andquot;thank youandquot; instead of andquot;i'm sorryandquot; when i'm correcting an error in the restaurant's favor and about to fork over an additional $150.	0
my girlfriend and i checked out mohawk bend last night. talk about a shit show. it was pretty busy, but there is no excuse for the unorganized and inconsistent staff. first of all the hostess wouldn't take us on the wait list because the wait list had lots of people on it. wtf? i walked around and there was 3 open tables. so, we went to the bar and had to wait 30 min for a beer. the bartenders we slow and didn't have knowledge of where anything was. they needed a bar back to help. three bartenders and 10 people in the kitchen bumping into each other. then we found a seat in the bar and the waitress said we couldn't order food in that area. huh? where is the defining line that says this area is food only and this area is drinks only, i asked. the waitress just walked away. nice service..so, then the manager comes by and says that we can order food anywhere we want. once we get our pizza and hour later, we were freezing with the ac cranked on our table. so, we moved to the bar that had since emptied out to finish our food. oh, the pizza was great, but the roasted artichoke was small and very dry for $9. at the bar, a waitress came by and said that we can't eat food at the bar... once again, what are we supposed to do here??? eat at the bar, not eat at the bar, stand up, walk in circles? you tell me. the management really needs to hire staff that can do their job and handle a busy night. i'd love to give this place another chance, but most likely will go somewhere else since they aren't able to serve customers properly.	0
i've been here twice and have been completely satisfied both times. i've never had to worry about finding parking or waiting for a table because i would take metro to the hollywood/vine station right after work. the restaurant is located within space15twenty next to urban outfitters and hennessy and ingalls. service is friendly and helpful (mostly young dudes), and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable with optional outside seating. $10 for a burger is ridiculous, you say? taste it and get back to me.i've had the umami burger and port/stilton burger. both very delicious!!! the meat (juicy! yummy!) is cooked medium rare unless otherwise asked. people complain about the burgers being too small. if it's quantity you're looking for, go get a big mac at mcdonald's. if you order fries, they come with a variety of yummy condiments. i think i prefer umami burger over father's office based on taste and environment (who do i have to bitch slap to order my food and get a table???). can't wait to try the other burgers!!!	1
had the shrimp pad thai. it was pretty tasteless and had dried shrimp in it. gross.	0
incredible food, open 24 hours, awesome staff!! what more could you ask for?! i had left my cell phone at one of the tables there at 3am after a night out, only to realize my phone is not with me in the parking lot. when we went back, the staff had kept the phone safe and sound! many thanks to olivia and bella and the rest of the staff for being so awesome. you all are amazing -- thank you!!!! :d	1
this place in my opinion makes one of the top 3 burgers in madison. cooked over a flame the bacon bourbon burger with some sort of aoli on it is money. however i have been moderately happy or disappointed every time i have ate the ribs (were smoked days prior), brisket or pulled pork. if you stick to the burgers this place is awesome!	0
country walk needed a fast food place like this one. you guys have to try the and maicitosand  is by far the best corn based meal you'll ever try.	1
we have been going to mountain branch through all of the owner ships, and the food has been consistent and a nice place to have to have  lunch or dinner. however they have made some negative changes that i think are going to hurt this place tremendously.   when you now order a meal say a steak, for $28.00, that is what you get a steak and a glass of water, no starch or vegetable. this place has lost it's value big time, over trying to make a profit. it is a shame, as long as they keep this policy we will no longer support this restaurant.	0
i'm not sure why it's labeled '$'. the prices are the same as everywhere else and the portions are smaller. they also arbitrarily tax you - which is odd for a cash-only place.  the food is ridiculously spicy. i even asked for less spice - it was on the receipt - and what i got was dark red and burned!!!   it's sad because the noodles/meat are delicious - you can taste the difference (if you order something without any spice at all).   if you have a cold though, get a soup mildly hot - it will clear out your sinuses in no time!	0
i love this place!! all it took was for my in-laws to take me and my wife on a first experience and my and i loved it!  since then, we've been going back for more!!  we have no complaints. the food is amazing and the staff are phenomenal!  i would recommend this to anyone!  since coming out of the hotel industry on strip, the charcoal room is well comparable to high end steak houses that are known for big names!  thank you for an excellent experience!!  open table as well for making this genius app!	1
my wife and i love this place. we eat there at least once a month and every time is better than before. garlic budies figlets grilled artichoke and kobe burger are our favorites	1
come early on the weekend! great breakfast food and great staff. got the favorite and eggs florentine, really tasty and fresh. portions were large and came with a cute little muffin.	1
just went in for drinks and watched amazing looking food pass me by... unfortunately the few drinks i tried were not so great. the worst by far was this mango cocktail (to be avoided!)	0
my boyfriend and i went here for valentine's day. we had a five course pre-set dinner menu (but 3 out of the 5 courses had options to choose from).  between the two of us we got the lentil soup, bruschetta, hummus and pita, baba ganoush, sea bass and lamp chops, followed by rice pudding and some kind of chocolate mousse (amazing) dessert with crunchy baklava-like pieces in it. the entire meal was super tasty and artfully crafted. even the zuccinis on our sea bass plate were cut into hearts. nice touch!  also, the lamb chops i had here were the best i've had in life. period.  the only reason i gave this place 4 stars is the service was a little off. it took a long time to get the first course. i asked for tea and the waitress forgot. we also asked for more pita to go with the hummus (ratio was off) and that took forever too.   all around great meal, but service could be more on point.	1
celebrated my 40th birthday at your restaurant. food was excellent,service was less then mediocre. very disappointed with the service. thank goodness the food was so great. i would recommend to a friend based off the food.	1
i guess mark neighborhood casserole shop as one of those things you didn't know you needed till you got one. fresh, delicious, friendly, inventive, and just all around with it.   had the biscuits and gravy then took home a kielbasa casserole and both were as close to home cooking as i've found yet in this city.   i'll give this place 10 glasses of water. cannot recommend it enough.	1
taj palace has been our go-to indian restaurant for the past year for these reasons 	1
used eat first boston web page to enjoy a sunday lunch.  the andquot;fact was a noisy jazz brunch.  food was tasty and creative.  service was excellent and attentive.	1
everytime i land in mia i head straight to calle ocho for pedro bello's cigars and a frita and batido de mamey from el rey!!  que rrrricura! delicious! ..and best of all.. a fast, cheap bite to eat!  truly el rey!!	1
love the new location in capital hill - that's our hood! :) my dear hunny and i did a date night here a couple months ago and we were quite impressed. reminds me, we must go back (i think their menu changes up regularly):	0
decor: a-cuisine: c-service: d+working in hospitality, i'm tough on restaurants and hotels i visit. i have expectations and they need to be met or exceeded for my money.i grew up in highland park and have been wanting to try maximiliano for quite some time. it's always seems buzzing with activity and even has valet (really?!)decor-i finally took my friend for dinner tonight. surprisingly small and nosey (similar to bottega louie) but had a smart approach to it's decor. the restroom feels and smells like the ones at union station :-/cuisine- the chicken ravioli wasn't worth keeping at the table, it was bland. the pot roasted chicken was juicy but the garlic spinach was bland and the potatoes were cold. the veal risotto was nothing to rave about. but the cheesecake du jour was delicious (it's made in-house but i forgot what it had since the server talked so fast) service-we got hector as our server: motor mouth server (he talked so fast we only understood half of what he said), nonchalant (when asked what he recommended, his reply was "everything's good but depends what you like" with no emotion), attitude and no sympathy when my friend sent back the chicken ravioli (he asked, "what's wrong with it?" with no apology) and got charged for someone else's bill (wth?!)great potential but fails to deliver once you're there. i wouldn't go out of my way to maximiliano for dinner. i'd rather deal with the noise at bottega louie. but i would go back for the cheesecake :-)	0
this place is a tiny little hole in the wall that i can see really taking off.  when you enter, it instantly has a mediterranean vibe there's a bar area to the side and a main dining area. the dining area is actually very spacious and wide open. the table layout though can make the meals feel quite intimate the staff here is extremely nice and helpful. we were greeted with a giant smile and a welcome. my and my friend weren't too well versed on the food and the host was sure to explain exactly what came in each dish the food was amazing. the skewers were melt in your mouth good and the lemon butter vegetables made me a convert. it comes with beef, chicken or steak. the sandwich was good, it had pork and other goodies slathered with sauce in a bun. i haven't sampled the pasta yet but my friend raves about how good it was. for dessert, there was mascarpone, which isn't a dessert i normally like but since the host recommended i decided to go with and let's just say i wasn't disappointed  --a few points notes, they don't have their liquor license as of 2/16/14 -- related to above, the bar area is really deserted  they also have a stage and what looks to be a setup for live music. whenever this does start being used, i can see it being a huge hit.  overall it a good restaurant, some things that i see them workin on and no reason why this wouldn't be 5 stars all the way!!	1
blackened grilled salmon, calamari fritti and burrata with prosciutto were out of this world. the focaccia was also very yummy. i spied some arancini that looked amazing, definitely going to try that my next time here. nice ambiance, attentive staff and relaxing atmosphere.	1
my wife had salmon that was terrible.  she didn't eat and the waiter did nothing about.	0
try the new ghost burger if you even wonder to this hidden gem in the sci-arc building. the ghost pepper aioli is a perfect touch to the already tasty burger. chris and paris are two of the friendliest guys serving food. these twin brothers are your taste buds. everything and anything they make is bomb. if you don't like the food they make you don't like food.	1
had a fantastic time - the brunch is simple and presented marvelously. the desserts are perfectly made and delicious. the staff is very attentive and the bartenders are so much fun. jay is a very knowledgeable manager and host. going back for dinner!	1
my dining experience at bea tonight was absolutely dreadful. the service here was by and large the worst i have ever encountered in a restaurant and in spite of the all the great reviews, the staff, in particular our waitress, should remember that the customer is always right. without a doubt there are times that this is not the case, but in tonight, it most definitely was, and she needed to have some integrity and take the fall for her mistake. the only logical reason why we could have been seated at 7:50, placed our orders at 8:10 and been served one hour later at 9:10 is if our waitress failed to give our orders to the kitchen in a timely fashion. the computer apparently showed that our orders hadn't been put in until 8:30, which leaves an unaccounted for 20 minutes between when we gave our orders to our waitress and the kitchen receiving it. this gap went unexplained by the restaurant manager, our waitress and the and event coordinator.and  there were three surrounding tables that had no guests before us, all of whom received their main courses before us, and one of which left before we even got ours. that is simply unacceptable, and particularly so without some sort of explanation from the restaurant staff. neither a round of the shots on the house that tables with good service also received nor a measly 10% compensation on the check made up for the horrific service that my table received this evening. we will not be returning, and our waitress should get a grip on what's more important: happy customers who want to come back to bea, or saving face on a sloppy, but human mistake.	0
mehhhhhh.. i really liked our waiter, but the food was not very impressive	0
yummy avocado salad.	1
this is a good start for dtla's upcoming scene. the st. cloud cocktail is amazing. actually tried to remake it at home.  food is expensive, i'd advise to go eat somewhere else first for dinner, then come here for some drinks and late night apps. the scene is amazing at night. live music, comfy seating, and your surrounded by lit up high rises. felt so shi shi.	1
pros: chocolate pudding cake key lime pie mac and cheese  cons: waited 45 minutes on line to hear that they were sold out of beef ribs, beans, collard greens and root beer. couldn't you put up a sign and inform your customers??? nope. you just had us all wait till we got to the front of the line to let us know. no bueno!  brisket was mediocre. needed some salt.  spare ribs were so dry i couldn't cut it with a knife nor my teeth.  potato salad was okay.  there was nothing outstanding. you don't have to waste a trip down to red hook to wait at least 45 minutes on line for mediocre food.	0
even though we had eaten breakfast a scant 45 minutes before coming here, we still endeavored to get the full experience and ended up ordering the #1 (grilled pork) and the #2 (caribbean) sandwiches. i was expecting a gustatory revelation but instead what i got was a very tasty, very messy sandwich which i am 95% sure that i could recreate to a 95% authenticity level... do the math on that one.	0
love love love this place. my boyfriend and i tried it for the first time tonite and loved it. we sat at the bar, and the actual sushi chefs were very nice and accommodating, very patient if you had questions about some of the fish as well. i had some tuna and yellowtail and we ordered a few rolls as well, and everything was fresh and melted in our mouths.the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because the servers weren't very attentive to us after we sat down. luckily, we were near one of the chefs who kept an eye on us, and if we needed anything, he made sure we got it right away. there was even a mix up with one of the orders of our dessert (ice cream) and he caught it and made sure it was fixed! for sure coming back to this place :) totally reminded me of my grandmothers japanese restaurant growing up!	1
i've been going to this place since i was a kid and i give it 1 star for being a historical place and another star for the speedy service. just check out the speed of the guy on the grill!with that being said, this is a horrible option for vegetarians! if you don't enjoy enormous pancakes whilst everyone else is eating a substantial meal, don't go because this is a steak and eggs, heart attack inducing restaurant. there is really nothing healthy here at all. my cholesterol is soaring just thinking about it!	0
in my opinion, you shouldn't have to go to another restaurant to feel satiated after you eat a semi-expensive "meal"...i give flour + water 2 stars for taste and decor, but -3 stars for the sub-appetizer sized portions.	0
fantastic ambiance great mac n cheese delicious fried apple tart thing full bar, yummy cocktails reserve a booth with curtains if you want intimacy.  i absolutely adore this place. this had become my new default restaurant.	1
went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating then. our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... we refused to pay that was not our mistake.	0
my girlfriend and i were searching for a nice dining spot to grab a quick bite, and for some time now i've had deli-in bookedmarked in my queue, so we decided to give this small hole-in-wall eatery a try.   my girlfriend praised this place for it's large portions, extremely friendly service and good food, and fortunately she was right.   as soon as you walk-in you'll notice that this place is quite tiny, however, once you're greeted by the friendly korean gentleman manning the cashier you'll find yourself smiling and pleased with your decision. the menu is quite diverse offering breakfast foods, sandwiches, dinner entrees, and latin/mexican food. and for those of you who speak spanish, the owner's son speaks fluent spanish, so feel free to test his spanish skills...;) haha  i ordered the club sandwich on wheat and my girlfriend ordered the grilled tilapia plate. the club sandwich was hearty and delicious, and with a side order of fries to round out my meal i was sufficiently filled and satisfied. unfortunately, my girlfriend was a bit disappointed with her selection, pointing out that the food tasted a tad bland, and after sampling some of her food i had to agree; the fish was slightly overcooked and the rice vegetable mix was lacking flavor.   now you may be wondering why i'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 3. simply put, the service and experience garners the extra star. don't get me wrong, deli-in offers great food for affordable prices, and if you decide to get some of their main specialties you'll surely won't be disappointed. however, if you do decide to order something out of the norm then understand that there's a 50/50 chance it'll be good or sub-par. the service here is outstanding however, the wait times can be long, but i suggest calling in your order ahead of time.  overall deli-in is an exceptional little diner that deserves the high praise that it has received, and i'll surely be coming back for more. to great eatings :)	1
carrabean roast was the best thing ever. ate it in it's entirety. licked up the drippings and forgot about the hour wait for the food.	0
great service, uptown burger was awesome best burger i've had in a while. good choice of drafts on tap.	1
beautiful location, nice decor.   don't expect them to respect your reservation time. we had reservations at 9:30pm, didn't get seated until 10:45pm. the hostess's response when asked about the reservation time, and yeah, but you're gonna have wait.and    the food was terrible. the only thing worth eating was the croquettes. but i mean really how can you possibly mess up with those? really not a place for dinner, more of a casual drink pre-party warm up location.  i won't be gong back, wouldn't recommend it either.	0
overrated historical place that is ok if you like greasy, oily eggs, saturated soggy toast, long to wait, fast served food. don't get the omelet...it's velvetta cheese and eggs. norms has better breakfasts	0
good and very tasty	1
my wife and i recently returned from a trip to new orleans where we experienced some fantastic (authentic) cajun cuisine. yearning for some good red beans and rice we picked up a couple of orders to go and took them home anticipating a culinary re-run of our trip. we were sadly disappointed. the food was so over-spiced we could not eat it. the tiny bits of meat did not compare to the huge hunks of sausage normally served in that dish. i spent 45 minutes trying to get through to the restaurant and could not. i eventually spoke with the manager who was supposed to taste the food and get back to me. (two days later that has yet to happen.) i want a refund. the food is not authentic cajun cuisine by any stretch of the imagination and not worth your time or money.	0
my rating is based on the service as we never got the chance to try the food.ordered the penne pasta and grilled chicken sandwich. after 30 minutes, we asked one of the servers where our food was. he said he would check.after another 5-8 minutes, someone else came over to our table and let us know they did not have any pasta. they kept "pushing our order" and taking orders for the pasta knowing none was prepared.why they couldn't just tell us that right away or even 10 minutes into the meal is beyond me. i asked her that question, but was given no answer.at that point, we left. when we were getting our refund (i think it was a manager, but she never identified herself so i don't know for sure), the cashier was very rude and just stared at us, like we did something wrong.i heard they service was bad and they were very slow in getting food to table. i thought it was due to being new... it looks more like poor management. i won't be dining there again.and if you're in a hurry or have limited time, go somewhere else.	0
the food is excellent but maybe because my family and i went on a late sunday night, the service was quite slow. we waited about 40 min for our first entree to be served. and they serve one dish at a time. if you are planning to order more than 1 dish, add 10 minutes to the aforementioned time.   tl;dr= excellent food, slow service	1
it's amazing i could be this disappointed by a meal i paid less than $3 for. looking at the 1000+ positive reviews i have to wonder if the had their d-squad in the kitchen today. the dumplings were chewy and tough. the sesame pancake was cold and the duck was pretty flavorless. i was raised to never waste food but i still couldn't bring myself to finish the food from prosperity. if you find yourself on eldridge st and craving dumplings do yourself a favor and walk the extra blocks to vanessa's.	0
opening in a beautiful new space in hollywood, oinkster has arrived to fulfill all your burger-fied dreams. with a full wrap-around parking lot and an incredible truffle aioli, the burgers and fries here never disappoint. hollywood now has oinksteraide on tap and ready to serve. slow fast food has never tasted so good! i love you oinkster!	1
i've tried just about everything from this place. delivery is super fast, food is always hot and tasty. i am hooked! i order directly from them instead of grubhub and i get to save a few bucks.	1
the mussels and lamb chops were incredible!! also the cocktails are delicious, especially the cucumber corpse revival! love this place as a friday night date night with my boyfriend!!	0
really excellent food, good coffee, plenty of other drinks to choose from, yummy pastries, warm atmosphere.	0
i can't even begin to tell you how horrible the food was here... the only reason i give bianca 2 stars is because of the dessert. i have to admit the tiramisu and flan was pretty good.  out of all four different pasta dishes we ordered, only the lasagna was acceptable. the black ink pasta special was not even edible (looked like dirt, tasted like salt and water!). everything else was not memorable.  would not recommend this place unless you are going for dessert.  i don't even know why this place have 4 stars.... but definitely recommend it to people you hate. :)	0
for me to even review this taco spot means i'm in love! i ordered the beef quesadilla with everything on it! maaaaaaaan, it was soooooooo good! fresh! juicy!  this is going to be a problem! it gave me that boost to do my chelsea shopping!  took off 1 star for no seating and because the quesadilla is waaaay too small for $4.50.	1
i stopped here because i was in the neighborhood and i love mediterranean food. the staff was friendly and welcoming, and it was a great dining experience. in addition to mediterranean food, they offer wood oven pizzas and sandwiches. i'll definitely be coming back here again!	1
canter's may be my favorite restaurant in los angeles. sometimes you just have to have matzoh ball soup. admittedly overpriced, canter's will be your jewish mother if you feel a cold coming on. why is matzoh ball soup univiersally expensive? it's just chicken stock and cracker meal; two of the cheapest ingredients possible. but i digress. they have yummy borscht too. latkes with sour cream. now i'm getting hungry.don't forget to ask for a pickle tray. oh yummy, crunchy pickles! your tangy sourness makes my tastebuds sing. there are crunchy bagel chips too.i usually get the pastrami reuben. veggies take note: veggie reubens are delicious and a nice change of pace. the fries are average; not always hot which is a big no-no.i guess canter's easily get two stars from me because i can pretend i'm in nyc. you can even extend the fantasy by going across the street to damiano's, the pizza joint. not that you'll be hungry but i guess you could have an unusual beer. i digress again. canter's marries an east coast vibe with old school hollywood gumshoe, tragic romance. the bar is tits. you can practically see bukowski on a bar stool at 2 p.m. on a tuesday. they pour 'em stiff and the price is right. wander in on any given random day and you will definitely see some characters. there may only be three, two, or one person but i guarantee your curiosity will be aroused. they book the weirdest bands (you never know what you will get) and it's not really recommended on a friday or saturday night (amateur hipsters, crowded, smoky sidewalk). please order only respectable drinks like whiskey or scotch. the "sex and the city" movie may be hot but cosmos went out years ago (and they are gross). the fact that you can order a real drink in the restaurant contributes to the stars above as well. it was quite dangerous when i lived around the corner. a great neighborhood. that stretch of fairfax from approximately wilshire to melrose being one of the very few reminding me of nyc (where else? maybe downtown?).i probably haven't eaten that many different things at canter's but it doesn't matter. i just love the whole scene. the people watching cannot be beat and you will see an occasional celeb. i once saw mike myers outside. i'm the farthest thing from a star-f*cker but i had to holler to him how great he is. he and his wife smiled. yay.let's not forget the bakery. authentic bagels-poppy, onion, everything-and some not-so-authentic bagels-pizza-are winners. you will become lost in a world of cookies, cheesecakes, rugala (recommended!), and marble ryes. a very wide selection of breads baked on the premises are available. a sweet-tooth fiend's (like me!) heaven!canter's is also a good place to go hang out and have a casual meeting or get some work done. their large center room is not always open (if not crowded) but they will let you spread out and work there, and, obviously, order something. the service can be inattentive and even verge on the border of being rude or hostile. while i normally cannot tolerate that, this only adds a little more east coast zing in the mix. i have also had cut-and-dry competency which is my favorite type of service. get it right, get it quick, no smarmy small talk. canter's you make me misty-eyed for the big apple but you offer a little slice to keep me going.	1
if you're willing to ignore the pretentious hostess (she does truly just look miserable to be seating the beautiful patrons of toast) and the generally slow service, you won't have any problems appreciating the appeal of toast.every menu item is delicious and healthy (the portobello press - pesto, mozzarella, portobello mushrooms, olives, sun-dried tomatoes - omg) and they've the best soup selection i've seen in years (not to mention their dressing options). there's literally something for everyone at toast, and i've never left dissatisfied with my meal.although it's clearly a place to 'see and be seen,' toast is 100% worth the long weekend-afternoon wait. just try their fresh-squeezed orange juice and tell me you disagree.	1
great restaurant. family owned and everything is made by them. true italian taste. the spaghetti and meatballs are my favorite and the tiramisu is perfect.	1
if i could give this place negative stars i would. the food is just not good! i can't say it any more plainly. food: i ordered the philly cheesesteak. 1) the meat was tough as all hell frozen over 2) the onions were not cooked enough and still had bite in them 3) the bread was like an old hot dog bun or something. also, i don't think their black and white cookies are even comparable to those at other delis.atmosphere: the ceiling consists of transparent fall leaf tiles that look like they belong on a polyester shirt. in fact, the whole place looks like a wormhole to the 70s and not in a good way (yes, i believe there is a good way). service: rude. just plain rude. not even rude coming from attractive men aspiring toward hollywood stardom, but from mumbling ladies faintly laced with cigarette smoke. the line to buy something from the deli can take forever, especially during peak hours. when you get to the front be prepared for additional rudeness.	0
this place is gross. food and health needs to inspect this place.	0
fast, friendly service and they deliver to lizard's. it's always tasty and fresh. such a welcome addition to the neighborhood!	1
pretty good but too much fatty brisket. go to milk burger. it's so much better.	0
when i only ordered sandwiches i was doing it all wrong. the way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. insane amount of food? yes. worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? yes!	0
i've been to randg lounge several times and the food is ok. nothing to write home about, but not too expensive considering it's filled with business people. normally 3 stars, but unfortunately today was a 1 star day. i ordered a chicken cashew rice plate, and the chicken looked like either chunks overcooked fish or malformed scallops. it didn't taste like chicken; tasted like overcooked fish, but the waiter confirmed that it was, fact, chicken.i've hardly ever returned food at a restaurant, but this called for it. i called the waiter over and told him that i would like to return it, and he seemed stunned. he said "i cannot do that." then he called over the manager. here is the conversation that ensued:me: hi. sorry, but i'd like to return this chicken. manager: what, you don't like it?me: no, sorry. could i please return it and get something else?manager: but you ordered it. it's your fault.me: ummm... yes, i did order it. sometimes at restaurants if people order food and don't like it, they return it and get a refund or can order something else instead.manager: i cannot give you a full refund. you can pay for half.me: you mean, i will pay for half, and you will give me a different dish?manager: no, you pay for half, then order a different dish and pay full price for that dish. would you like to order something else?me: no thanks. i'll just pay half price for this.so much for customer service!	0
perfect place to start a party night. great food great drinks. the view of downtown skyline is awesome.	1
i am vacationing in south florida, so i have eaten at 3 different cuban restaurants, and this one was my least favorite. the beef and chicken emapandas taste bland. the house salad was a lump of iceburg lettuce with a few garbanzo beans. if you must eat there stick with black beans, rice, and sweet fried plantains. stay away from the huge lump of beef in the kid's burger yuck.. dry as a bone.	0
the guacamole! oh the guacamole!!! this is a definite must have when you go to escuela. the tacos are on the small side but they have some really great unique options. my favorite is the crispy beef and pickle taco. i would highly recommend trying that one.   the service is a bit slow but the place is always crowded so i can't fault them too much for that. this place would get 5 stars from me if the service was a bit more on their game. but overall this is a really great joint for some delicious mexican food.	1
**i did not eat here**  pretentious staff. overly crowded. two hour wait. shallow wine pour.   wanted to dine here for a few years now, and upon finally attempting to, i was nothing but disappointed with the experience. i totally expected to wait, but two hours with zero waiting room and a snobby staff wasn't worth it. i ordered a glass of wine (to drink on the cement outside) and for $12 i received a tasting pour. i noticed an older couple waiting next to me kindly tell the server that their wine pours were very shallow and that they hated to complain but would like to be topped off, and the server basically just said, and too bad,and  and walked away briskly. i took my shot of wine and kept my mouth shut.   needless to say i left, and i won't be back. i am sure the food is amazing, but sometimes even that is not worth it.	0
the reviews citing the small portions and absurd prices are right on. the food is definitely good but the pasta dishes (entrees) take up about 1/4 of a regular small cereal bowl. the chicken liver was great as was the bread. further, what is a red hook restaurant doing with a $24 glass of wine on the menu. what's more, our server seemed totally unaware of the quality of the wine. my wife wondered which wine was dryest, the waitress read off the menu and based her suggestion on that. the glass was $15.	0
pancakes are huge so share with someone. cash only, i went early saturday morning and waited about 30 minutes for 2. not bad but standing there as if i was waiting for an awesome concert ehhh not the business. the also have another line for those who want to sit at the counter and its normally shorter from what i have seen.  simple menu, good food and great prices. love how all the employees have been there for double digit years makes it feel homey.	1
excellent!  i got the large bbq beef plate and it was delicious. it comes with a good amount of beef and the dressing on the salad is very good too.	1
i'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent. first of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple newbies. the beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which i thought was a great price. the burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries. i will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town.	0
meh. just meh.came here for breakfast one morning and left disappointed. i ordered the pizza w/ sunnyside up eggs and really wasn't a fan. the crust was too thin and too flaky. boyfriend got the eggs fungi poached w/ roasted mushrooms, which was a little better, but not amazing.as for the service, again, just meh. you get "meh" service from little hole-in-the-wall restaurants, not a place like this. for being such a prominent place in the heart of los feliz, i guess i just expected more... especially for the price you're paying.	0
this place is a huge disappointment. great location, spectacular view...everything else is not worth it at all. they lost our reservation, and once we were seated, we waited 20 minutes until the waitress even came to the table to take our drink order, then waited another 20 minutes to get 2 glasses of wine, which were barely even filled half way at $14 a pop. they were out of all but one beer on the menu. the tuna tartar was virtually tasteless and wasn't made with the ingredients on the menu. the shrimp cocktail appetizer was doused in a wasabi sauce that tasted like it was straight from a tube at the grocery store. they were out of the red snapper and didn't bother to tell us until 15 minutes after we had ordered our meal. the poor waitress was slammed and the management didn't bother to help her at all. everyone seemed so inattentive even though our table was in the middle of the room right next to the bar. the only good thing was their french fries- but they didn't come until after we had both finished our meal.   not worth the money or the view :(	0
great burger, nice atmosphere.	1
ordered the penne chicken and mushroom which is 10.75 and and a medium cheese pizza which is 10.85 and somehow my total came up to 26.95. i asked the delivery driver if there was an extra charge for delivery he said no so i'm at a loss as to why they jacked the price up.	0
the service: a - the waiters are friendly and attentive.the food: a+ - yes it's expensive, but the portions are large, the food tastes great, and the presentation is on point! i was told prior to going that the food was mediocre, however, my entire party thought the food was delicious! lobster mac and cheese was the best so i highly recommend that as a must!drinks: a - everything was tasty and looked really cool. their drinks are definitely on the stronger side. you're paying about $20 per drink, so at least they don't stiff you on the alcohol.presentation: a+++ - very unique!!ambiance: a- - it's loud and very very crowded. if i could get more than 6 inches to move on either side of me, i would've been much happier. that's my only complaint about barton g.definitely somewhere you have to go at least once. but be prepared for the hefty price tag!! and i do mean, hefty!!!	1
this is a great place to enjoy a wonderful meal with a group. it is clear that the owners of the kitchen understand their job -- to provide excellent service and outstanding food to their patrons. they carry this through to even the largest groups. we had attentive service on this very busy night. our waiter didn't rush us and even took time to answer many questions posed by members of our group as well as offering his suggestions.  we all drank white wine by the bottle. i thought it was interesting that the pour was shallow, more like a taste than a full glass. later i appreciated this strategy in that the glasses were refreshed often and it paced everyone in their drinking. you must try the fresh oysters. the only thing wrong with them was that they disappeared from my plate too quickly, they were so good that i didn't even share them with others!	1
i stumbled across this place while wondering the streets of seattle searching for the least romantic place to get a bite to eat on vday. the ingredients were great and fresh and the price was perfect. the pizza came fast and hot. great find!	1
i tried the umami burger, tempura onion rings and sweet potato fries. keep in mind that they do cook their burgers medium rare. the burger was moist and juicy. i really enjoyed the bun that they used for the burger. the sweet potato fries with the garlic aioli was my favorite part of the meal because it had a nice balance of flavors. to top it off, i found out that one of our friends works there who i haven't seen in years. so that was a nice touch! =]	1
the hostess was wonderful, the man who came to take our drink order was amazing. the waiter was distracted. the salmon was delicious, all 2oz of it. my friend's burger was juicy and delicious. drinks were quite good. i'd like to give it another chance; but seriously, the size of the salmon portion was a joke. i would have brought it up with the staff but i had a concert to get to. flavors were good, ambiance very nice. it's been there forever so they must be doing something right.	0
meh.  it was ok, but honestly, didn't have enough flavor.  honestly, popeye's does it better.  the dining room, show venue, bowling alley was really great though.  would love to come back with a group of friends for a fun night of music and bowling.  food was a 3 but venue is a 4.5.	1
this place is great. two brothers making traditional tunisian food with passion and care. hummus, pita, grilled chicken and salads are all amazing! can't wait to try the rest of the menu.	1
great experience at perch. i wanted a romantic dinner for my so's birthday with very specific instructions that involved presentation of a gift, champagne, and dessert. they got us a great table with a view, the food was delicious (albeit expensive), the view was beautiful, the live music was good, and the overall atmosphere was exactly what i wanted. the hosts and server were excellent at making it happen. not sure how to top that next year.	1
had the bone in rib eye. the meat was cooked to order.  the bread was excellent.  it took a little too long for the salad to come out.	1
had great seating even after snagging a last minute 7:45pm reservation. the food was great but not amazing, and the service was decent but not stellar. i asked to replace lettuce in my salad for arugula and the server refused, despite having arugula on the menu. some of the dishes could have had better presentation but still overall pretty yummy. love the decor, which is reminiscent of a more upscale the smith restaurant	1
my sister and i had reservations for dinner here on a friday evening. we were staying at the orlando hotel, which is where this restaurant is located. it's a very trendy, hipster looking place (i.e. they serve water in mason jars). we sat outside which is a really nice set up with pretty lights - definitely a nice place for a date!we ended up getting their corn pizza, tuscan kale salad, and mac and cheese. the corn pizza was pretty good! it had lamb pancetta, serrano chiles, sundried tomatoes, and arugula. it had the perfect combo of sweet and savory. i don't know if they put it on, but it had an almost truffle oil hint on it. yum! the kale salad was also good, with goat cheese, currants, raisins, and meyer lemon. kale can usually taste pretty bitter, but not this one!as for the mac and cheese....ew. i don't recommend this dish unless you like your mac and cheese tasting like nacho cheese/velveeta. not only was the cheese too artificial tasting, but the macaroni was swimming in the cheese, which i personally don't like. we didn't like it so much that we requested to switch it for another dish. our waitress was very accommodating and switched it no problem - great service! we ended up getting their cauliflower dish - recommended by our waitress. holy crap it was so good. definitely made up for the mac and cheese. the cauliflower had a lot of spices on it - reminding me a lot of curry flavors. as if that wasn't good already, there was a creamy sauce underneath the cauliflower which went amazingly with it! probably my favorite dish out of everything we ordered - highly recommended!!overall a pretty satisfying meal. good food (aside from the mac and cheese) and solid service! wouldn't come out of my way to eat here, but it was definitely an enjoyable place since i was in the area :)	1
ok umami, you win.friday night 8 of us went here for a friend's birthday. my friend and i decided to split 2 of their special burgers. one of which was the pork belly burger and the other the turkey blta.the pork belly burger, while i'm not entirely sure what was all on it included a blend of pork/beef for the meat, covered with thick chunks of bacon, some form of special (not too hot) hot sauce, onions, and avocado. this was pure heaven in burger form. i wished we wouldn't have split this one, but i was honestly just about full from that half. my mouth was seriously so happy with each and every bite that i took.next up was my half of the turkey blta (this might have another special name, but i wasn't paying much attention to the names, just the tastes). simple: turkey burger, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. it was good, not great, but it was exactly what i expected a turkey burger to taste like... a little bland, not as juicy, but still really tasty.we also ordered the cheesy tots which i guess are a special menu item as well, i didn't taste much cheese, but tots + their ketchup are more than worth ordering so i disregarded the fact that they were supposed to be "cheesy." as for beverages, most of the table ordered cherry cokes (the adult kind)... i have no idea what was in them, but they were strong, sweet, and included the rest of the mexican coke that was poured into them. mmm... mexican coke. one of my weaknesses.my table also ordered the pickle platter because they pickle their own... pickles... i'm not a fan of pickles, but it seemed to be a big hit with my table. last but not least, my biggest gripe with my previous visit... the service. i wanted to murder my waitress from my original visit, but this time, our waitress erin (what a great name!) was a total sweet heart, she was attentive, polite, and totally kick ass. for a friday night i didn't expect such wonderful service, but she was awesome and got us everything we needed when we asked for it. i will definitely revisit umami if the opportunity presents itself, but i think my waistline will tell me stay away. i ate way too much food but was totally and completely satisfied.	1
i end up coming here about once or twice a year on their <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.comands=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a>. but after last time i think i need to make it more like once a month. came here with a group of 4 with a 50 to spend 10 deal.   the food is always solid but the service from constance was over the top amazing.  i always get the goat cheese fondue and i will always continue too.  the potato leak soup that was on special was probably the tastiest thing i had all night. best potato leak ever.  the mac n cheese was good but not the best i've had in town. it's very indulgent so get it to share. the salmon entree is exceptional. a perfect glaze on top of a crispy flaked salmon steak.  the desserts were good but not the best creme brule i've ever had. the chocolate brownie was good but also not the most amazing i've had.  overall the tab for 4 came to $160 with the discount and tip included. would have been cheaper is we wouldn't have gone all out (3 apps, 2 desserts, etc).  to save we brought our own wine and the 12.50 corkage is very reasonable.	1
if you like something different this is the perfect place!! i love their friendly service and all their dishes had the same price of 10 dollars!!! i loved their charshiu pork skewer and also their pork belly some!!	1
this place sucks! never order their food to go. i ordered the chicken noodle soup and asked them to replace the noodles with vegetables because i dont eat noodles. when i get my order all it is, is greasy tasteless broth two tiny bits of chicken and all bean sprouts! i called the place back and told them that i had ordered vegetables instead of noodles but all i got were bean sprouts. the lady refused to give me a new soup and said i have to specify "mixed veggies" next time and vegatables mean bean sprouts... which is total bullshit! i asked if i could get a new soup and she said no... i order from here at least twice a week and they cant replace a $5 dollar soup? f*** this place!	0
after all the hype, i was very disappointed with this place. i always order the regular shio ramen with shredded pork. the shredded pork here was so bland and dry. pork buns were average. there wasn't enough soup in the bowl and i ended up drinking all the soup halfway through my meal which is always bad. the quality of the soup was not up to par as ippudo or momofuku. when i was halfway done with my meal, the waitress plopped my receipt down which was absolutely rude of them. can't i enjoy my lunch in peace?	0
if you want to go back in time for a good burger, apple pan is the place!   it's hard to think of a better combination than a burger, fries, coke, and apple pie. and when the food is as fresh and tasty as this place, it makes it even better!  the layout of the place is a little strange. it's essentially one large counter surrounding the place. makes it hard to go with a bunch of people since it's typically packed. the plaid on the walls is hilarious and a great touch showing how old-timey this place is. the service is unbelievably fast and if for some reason you do have to wait, trust me, it's worth it.   the burgers and pie taste like something you would have eaten at a bbq as a kid. real homemade goodness, nothing like a fast food burger. the old school flair continues in everything from the cash register to the staff to the paper cups.   only downsides are the lack of seating, the seating style and line make you feel rushed to eat, the prices are a little on the higher side, and i don't believe they take credit cards.   either way, this is a burger place that is worth every penny.	1
came here on a wednesday night for dinner and a cocktail. had been wanting to stop by for a while but never got to it. glad i finally did. went with the filet mignon as the entree. i made a good choice. full of flavor. ambiance is cool and the lighting is just the way i like it. the majority of people here are dressed to impress. that's another plus. no kids or hoodlums, very chill crowd. will be back	1
as many have mentioned the menu is huge and slightly confusing/daunting maybe even a little overpowering. i walked in with my sister and straight off we liked the location and aesthetic. i knew i wanted the banana french toast and she ordered an egg sandwich. i also ordered a chocolate milk (please note i am a chocolate milk connoisseur).   well i am sad to say, i was disappointed first in my chocolate milk which somehow tasted watery, yuckkky. and then in my french toast, which i ended up scraping the cinnamon and bananas out of.  my sister faired better but wasn't really impressed either.  this place is not a destination dine, where you'll come here for the food. instead, it is a quick fix type of place and not a cheap one at that.  i might go back because when i mentioned my experience a friend told me i should go for lunch.... maybe i'll need an easy go to but it won't be my first choice.	0
excellent atmosphere, unbelievably fresh seafood, and amazing cocktails that are unique and refreshing. highly recommended for a special occasion, or just a night of andquot;wow'sandquot;.	1
everything about this restaurant was wonderful, the service made my party feel like family with the italian hospitality, the food was amazing and was the portion sizes were just perfect. i had littleneck clams in a white wine sauce over linguine and it was absolutely delicious. the tiramisu was very light and creamy and was a great combo with the cappuccino. i was highly satisfied and would recommend lucia's for anyone wanting a true italian meal in a cozy setting.	1
best bloody mary!	1
there are so many things that make this place a keeper! it feels like you are inside a postcard of the los angeles skyline. the outdoor fireplaces and bench seat tables add a sense of community within your group. everything i tasted was flavorful and rich. the brie pastry appetizer, the wild mushroom risotto and the brussels sprouts we're my favorite items on the menu.	1
well, we've found our new favorite brunch spot around green lake. we had the bailey's french toast, which was a perfectly cooked, thickly cut piece of delicious brioche. we also had the winner winner chicken fritter. the presentation was spectacular and the food even better. we will definitely be back, both for the brunch, and anytime we need some bacon or a cheesecake for an event - all their cured meats and pastries looked amazing as well.	1
great tasting food!!!!	1
came here for a girls get together after not having seen everyone in a long time. was looking forward to seeing everyone and having a good time. now first looking at the place online, it says it is small. but when you get there they really mean it, the place is tiny. though there are three levels, all are each just as small as the other and one server per floor. we didnt really mind this at first because it creates a cozy and intimate experience.  we started off with the happy hour at the bar on the second level while we waited for our table and then were shown our seats on the third floor. the food is good but does not out way the service that we experienced. my friends and i are between 23-26 years old. we were the youngest people there and as such we were ignored and had to call numerous times to get someones attention. the other tables had no such problem. we asked for the desert menu twice before just giving up and paying for our bill, which also took forever to get.  dont get me wrong, the food was good. but i would not go back just for that. maybe the bar. if they had more people helping, then perhaps it would be a better time.	0
upper is not as crowded, more spacious and quieter than its lower counterpart. same great service and drink, the edibles are better here as well as the seating.	0
banzo knows their beans.	0
took my visiting brother there for breakfast and was very happy. we shared two different breakfast crepes and they were both outstanding. a cozy homey atmosphere good coffee and nice employees rounded out the experience. i'd definitely go again if i was in the neighborhood.	1
i love that they deliver, and the service is prompt. i'll get them sometimes, but i've never been blown away by how good the burritos actually are.	0
shhhhhh.....nobody let this restaurant get out, i fear the goldie will come and blow up this small reesturant in an unassuming plaza. i was going to zion market to pick up some stuff, and my hankering for korean anything but bbq has finally led my footsteps here. i have the ethnic food 3 signs of awesome.  number 1. can i understand the menu on the wall? nope. so check  number 2. is it filled with it's intended ethnic group and nothing else? check.  number 3. is it damn loud and busy? check!  i had d the kimchi kal gyusol and it came in a portion bigger than my face. i just couldn't seem to put a dent in that thing. i brought it home to my boyfriend and he finished it up.  it was so good! just...awesome. perfect for a night of drinking. one thing to note is that don't expect good service. service is terrible, but i'm used to it and could care less if the food makes up for it. and it did!	1
nothing special with this place.	1
i raise them one star for their stance on the micro beer issue.  people are starting to wake up that we have the power to fight back and fight we will. great dane is doing the absolute right thing. thank you great dane!	0
great food and ambience. had their thai beef salad after the gym. my friend loved their curry! planning on going back for sure.	1
one star for serviceone star for locationbland tasteless food. if it wasn't for happy hour, i'd be even more pissed. i thought i'd order a variety of appetizers to get a good idea of their food so i got a bowl of chowder, the steamed mussels, the boil and peel shrimp, and cajon corn on the cobb. just horrible. everything was tasteless and quality sucked. for $13, i'd expect the shrimp to be a little more fresh and tasty. but i guess they got it wrong. only thing great was the service. i wont be coming back here again. that's for sure.	0
i went to world of beer with my friends last friday and we ordered a bottle of wine and shared it. i didn't see the receipt until my friend gave it to me which is two days later. when i saw the receipt, i found out that the wine charged on the receipt is not the one we order and it's more expensive. the wine showed on my receipt is not even on the bar's menu. i called back the first time and the manager explained that they are going to change the whole menu for next month (jan, 2015) and the wine on my receipt is one of the coming menu which is not on the current menu. however, the manager refused to refund the difference because she said that we already drank the bottle! i called back and argued with her that we are not supposed to pay for the bottle which is not on the menu. she said she need to and make a calland  before she can reply me. finally she agreed to refund me the stupid difference. guys, please be careful when you sign your check because they might put the wrong bottle on your check and charge you more!	0
don't go here. the potatoes were the only good thing. pancakes sucked. french toast sucked. eggs were good, but that's hard to screw up.	0
vegas has it's share of top notch dining spots but you should certainly give bandb a shot.  don't miss the octopus appetizer which is fantastic!! (and i don't even like seafood that much).also the salumi sampler is just out of this world.  everything is cured in house and tastes simple divine.  the cotto and capricola were very good, as were the cured loin but the star, and excuse me because i don't recall the exact name, was the porcetta which looks like proscuitto but its 10 times better.  the fat simply melts in your mouth like butter.  my words can't do it justice.  when ordered for 2, the sampler comes with fried dough which is really the icing on the cake.  the pasta was very good but nothing special i am sad to say. having eaten at babbo and del posto in ny, i expected better. but i think it would be different had we had  the pasta tasting menu which is definitely more inventive.  still, don't let me dissuade you, give it a try.	1
ambitious menu foiled by incredibly bad service.  i've been here many times over the years, i live right down the street. this place is so inconsistent, you never really know what to expect. but after my last visit i'm not sure if there's anything that can get me to go back.  the waiter was way too busy to, um, wait on us. when he did grace us with his presence he proved that he knew nothing about the food that was on the menu.  i asked about a fish dish which he described as, and kind of like a sea bassand  and that it was and grilledand . what i got was a tiny trout-like fish steamed in parchment paper. it took a lifetime for our main courses to arrive and when my entree came it was barely warmer than room temperature. i was starving so i ate it anyway. i think it would have been good if it was warm.   my girlfriend asked if her dish would come with vegetables since she was craving veggies. he assured her, yes. when it came it was actually a bouillabaisse in which the vegetables were pureed inside the broth. no visible veggies at all. at least her dish was hot and, despite the lack of greenery, it was pretty good.   then our dirty dishes stayed on our table forever as we tried to flag down our waiter for the check. this was on a wednesday and not even very busy. it seemed like we were at this restaurant for an eternity.   the ambience and menu is what makes this place so popular and i have had good experiences here in the past. but bad service spoils the whole experience for me so i think i'll head to blair's the next time i'm in the mood for fine dining in silverlake.	0
came here for brunch today and was extremely disappointed. my bf ordered eggs benedict and i ordered the baked eggs dish which came with spinach, potatoes, bacon and potatoes. we also ordered the ricotta pancake to share because they ran out of the french toast. who runs out of french toast on easter sunday?! i can only assume these people prepare everything in advance and pop it in to cook as the orders come. the fact that the chefs weren't willing to whip up fresh new batches of french toast irks me. the pancake we got was also uncooked. the middle of the pancake oozed uncooked batter. for our main dishes, everything was so oversalted it was inedible. the bacon they serve is really chunks of ham, not the classic crispy strips that i crave. our service was fine and for being packed, we were in and out quick. honestly, i am done giving this place a chance. i really had to restrain from sending everything back and complaining. easter brunch = fail	0
i actually love the food and am a frequent customer of this restaurant. however, my last experience with them left me incredibly upset. i ordered food online for delivery. after the estimated 45 minute wait time was up, i called the place to get an update. the employee i spoke with said he would call his driver and get an update. he then said the driver had already left and my food was headed to me. i live literally 2 minutes driving from this place. no food about an hour later. i call again. the employee says again, and oh let me call the driver.and  so now i question whether he called the driver in the first place. so i just cancel my order. a total of 2 hours pass and i get a call that my food had arrived. so this tells me that the employee never called the driver to inquire about the status of my food and was blatantly lying to me. clearly i went to another thai spot to get food. i was highly disappointed because i did like this place so much and was a regular customer.	0
i don't really write reviews on anywhere, but i had to today. this was one of our favorite restaurants until what happened today. the lady who answered the phone has no courtesy/customer service whatsoever. there was a mistake on our delivery order so we returned the food and called the restaurant to let them know what happened. first, the man answered the phone, so my husband explained about the situation and the man was being very kind and apologetic. but all of a sudden, this lady (who took the order in the beginning) snatched the phone and started yelling at my husband saying that it was all his fault. okay..so if it was our fault and she let us know in a kind way, we would've admitted and apologized, but she was being so bitchy and yelled at my husband nonstop. (it was so loud that i could hear her voice over the phone). we couldn't believe how she treated us/customers like that. se was very very rude and felt like she needs anger management class. wish i could give neg stars!	0
i am used to being able to find some dishes such as humus made with olive oil at mediterranean restaurants. i tried to find out if this restaurant has some of these dishes by phone but it was too hard to understand the man. so we then went to the restaurant hoping to get our questions answered. the owner a man was entirely rude. as far as he was concerned he had done any answering he was willing to do on the phone. he refused to answer our questions. pretty much everything was made with vegetable oil which is gmo oils like soybean corn and canola. i believe his total rudeness had to do with me being a woman - who should be seen and not heard like in the country he is from. finally i asked if he had tea and he said no basically refusing to serve us. a female relative embarrassed by him tried to help us despite him but we left. we have since found house of kabob on colorado blvd that uses olive oil exclusively. and everything is delicious!	0
an utter disaster.	0
yum. yum. yum.  my husband and i headed here one crisp fall morning for some coffee and crepes. we were not disappointed.  the place wasn't busy when we walked in, but it was early, maybe 8:30 on a sunday morning. we chose a cute little table and ordered coffee pretty quickly. their coffee was great. it takes a little bit of extra time because it's from a french press, but it is worth it!  for crepes, both of us went with savory after much debating - they all sounded delicious! i had the chicken, mushroom and cheese ( i chose swiss) crepe, and my husband had the chicken and caramelized onion with avocado sauce crepe. both were served wit ha side of sriracha. we both tried the other's crepe and both were really good, but i think the chicken and onion one was just a tad tastier. maybe it was the perfectly done caramelized onions with just a hint of spice when you added the sriracha, but i'm still thinking about it.  when we left around 10:15, there were a couple of other tables taken, so it still wasn't super busy. this would be a great place to bring a great book, relax on one of the couches, and just linger. i even commented that i thought this would be great for a girlfriends' lazy brunch or a book club.  parking wasn't bad (we parked across the street), but it was early in the morning. it's the time of day that i like to say the city hasn't woken up yet.  quite the neighborhood gem. try this place.	1
top reasons why they deserve a 5 star from me. - they're open 24hrs - love their chipotle chicken panini - love their plate (grilled chicken)- plain cheesecake have just the right amount of sugar for me - most important they deliver anytime of the day and night!!! have pretty much tried all their sandwiches but the chipotle chicken panini is what i would recommend.	1
i ate there last month -the food was ok but the place need some cleaning and renewing. friendly staff.	0
i came here with my family for dine la, and was not disappointed! for appetizer, i got the heirloom tomatoes with burrata cheese, which was amazing. i loved the combination. i ordered the fish dish - forget the name of it but it was from hawaii and tasted very mild. worked well with the savory veggies. and last but not least, i tried the chocolate mousse which was delicious and not too sweet. i also got to sample food from my family, and i really liked the butter lettuce and the panna cotta dessert.this place gets a little busy on fridays especially with the lacma events so book an appointment in advance. we were able to get a reservation at 8:15.	1
i hardly ever write a review, but my experience here was terrible. first, the service was horrid. our waitress brought out our order wrong but insisted that we ordered what she brought us. we did not. when we kindly asked her if we could have our platter made into a wrap, she told us the kitchen was too busy. second, the food was atrocious. my beef was full of fat and blandly seasoned. my friend's chicken was still pink. i will never return.	0
granted, i came here with an extremely large group, but it was brunch and we were not rowdy. the food was alright, nothing amazing, but the service really sucked. we were all very nice and polite to the waitress but she was snarky and had a big attitude problem. we had all sent in our orders a week in advance, but after waiting for an hour for our food, i asked if mine was ready. she snapped that we had come in last, so no, it wasn't ready. whaaaaaaaaale, soooorrrry, what was the point in sending in our order a week early then? i make it a point to be extra courteous to service staff, so it really grinds my gears when i get a crock of undeserved rudeness in return.	0
this is such a nice place .. we were early for our opentable reservation and it was freezing out ...and the restaurant was not open for another 45 mins for dinner.. the hostess kindly let us hang out at bar and have a drink and warm up..  we had a beet salad that was fresh and delicious and i had the pork, for dinner, which was very tasty ... by friend ordered the grass fed beef and they mistakenly put in the order as a cheddar burger.. when that came it looked so amazing i wanted to keep it lol.. they apologized profusely and insisted on fixing it and giving us free drinks for the error.. the manager, waitress, hostess and bartender all over to apologize.. the beef and fingerling potatoes were fabulous when they came.. dessert was a treat as well.. a custard with pistachios with a caramelized top with ice cream ... the bill was incorrect as we received someone else's. it took awhile to fix but the food was so good and the service so attentive that we didn't mind too much.. nice atmosphere.. will definitely go back to try their brunch.	1
pros: -gorgeous view -atmosphere/vibe/diversity -strong, yet tasty drinks-heat lamps outside-cheap $5 parking lot on the corner (rare at a hot spot in downtown la)cons:-food.cordon bleu poppers- kind of dry, but tastyduck, duck, goose - my girlfriends said it was goodpetite croque madam - this was decent and probably the best food we ordered of the 5 dishespork confit cassulet - good portion since it's an entree, but very saltyroasted bone marrow - utter disappointment. if you want delicious bone marrow, go to "animal"	1
beautiful restaurant with decent food, slightly on the more expensive side though. i'd say not worth coming back for the food (however the atmosphere is divine)	1
i've been to the magnolia pub and brewery three times and each time i kept wishing the place would deliver. always going back at the urging of my alleged, "hip" friends. this place definitely struck out. i just don't understand the attraction. this is the worst wait service i've come across in this city. the beer is mediocre at best. it has zero ventilation not to mention zero room for diners. on top of all that, just try and carry on a conversation with someone in this place. absolutely impossible. definitely not worth the trouble.	0
so so yummy! portion size isn't huge, but definitely worth it flavor wise!	1
amazing greek food! shrimp spaghetti is the best i've had and the pita can't be beat, our server was roslin, definitely the best server we've had in a long time, fast, personable, and helpful with explaining the dishes, had the pleasure of meeting and talking to the owner helen, very sweet lady besides the smell of alcohol on her breath which to me is unprofessional especially considering we can't have a drink because they don't have their license yet! lol i'm sure she was trying to be helpful but she seemed to be trying to talk over roslin when she was trying to get our order, again just unprofessional maybe waiting until the actual server is done getting our order and explaining the food before she goes to tables to chat would be better or more professional/respectful, the chef came and checked on us and made sure the food was to our liking overall great experience good job and welcome to the neighborhood	1
appetizers are junk, seafood isn't fresh, but at least the steak dishes are pretty rad and and the live music is fun.	0
what the heck is going on with daikokuya lately? that's actually where i was supposed to eat, but with this cold weather, it seems like everyone wants to eat there too! i guess great minds think alike? the wait was 30 minutes minimum and it was a crazy house in there with people waiting around, so restaurant oomasa here i go!i've walked by oomasa plenty of times but had never even been inside. right away i liked that there were japanese people (i think authenticity when i can get it) and they had picnic benches as tables! good for groups!i wanted some soup since i didn't get to have any ramen, so i ordered miso. apparently there are different kinds of miso soup! clam, seaweed, or mushroom he asked. i was confuzzled so i asked which one he liked the most and he said the clam was the most popular. really???? who knew right? so of course i had to try it. my friend and i both got it and i must say it was delish! you have to be a seafood/clam person to like it though. there were clams in the soup and the broth was a little clammy as well. mmmmmmm. i got the #4 dinner combination. sashimi, sushi, salad, and chicken teriyaki. i had the sashimi (tuna and salmon only), the sushi, and the salad. wow was the meal friggin huge! i didn't even touch the teriyaki but that's where my brother aka my garbage disposal comes in. they even give you green tea ice cream as well! did i have it? heck yes i did! i guess that's cheat meal #2 for the week but i'll just work extra hard. green tea ice cream and sushi! how can i resist!!! now that is the way to my heart. *sighgood service, good food, benches were a bit uncomfortable after a while but not bad, roomy seating, and an overall good time. :)	1
love the restaurant, ray's. they have great food and great service. stark bar has great drinks and food, but the service is a bit iffy. that's why only four stars. every time i go to the bar, it takes a long time to get a drink and forever for the check.	1
i have definitely experienced better. if you want poke, i suggest going somewhere else. it looked fresh and all but the flavor is just not there. the fish just tasted bland. the hawaiian style poke was missing something. the spicy garlic and spicy poke were just spicy. it over power any possible flavors.not sure how this place got great reviews.  location is hidden too. not the easy to find. especially if you are a new transplant to vegas. **points to self** this is just my opinion. if you want to go try it out for yourself do it. not everyone has the same taste buds. mine just doesn't like this place.	0
paseo is delicious.	1
i've been to this restaurant before with my husband this time went with a group of 8 of us. chips and salsa were pretty good although you have to ask for it. i got the wagyu beef tacos and they really were just not good at all. the beef was very chewy i even had two friends try it to make sure that it wasn't just me. however the reason i gave it four stars on service is because the manager came by and noticed that i hadn't eaten my dinner and was very apologetic and took it off our bill without us even asking. i did have the tortilla soup which is different than traditional tortilla soup but i thought it was fantastic. overall i think it's a good place to go, everyone else's meals were really good no complaints and  the service was good too.	1
